## Sentence Summary

MIP7 defines processes for onboarding and offboarding domain teams.

## Paragraph Summary

The Domain Teams Onboarding & Offboarding proposal provides a predictable framework for both onboarding and offboarding domain teams required for the collateral onboarding process.

## Component Summary

**MIP7c1: Domain Team Descriptions**  
Describes the various domain teams and their responsibilities as they relate to the collateral onboarding process.

**MIP7c2: The Current Domain Roles List**  
A list component that is kept up-to-date with the currently ratified domain teams.

**MIP7c3: Domain Team onboarding**  
A process component that defines a method and a template that allows the onboarding of domain teams.

**MIP7c4: Domain Team offboarding**  
A process component that defines a method and a template that allows the offboarding of domain teams.

## Motivation

The Maker Protocol requires a decentralized workforce in order to onboard new collateral assets. This MIP  describes Domain Teams that are needed in the collateral onboarding process and highlights their special authority in the governance system to oversee critical processes and mitigate risk.

## Specification / Proposal Details

### MIP7c1: Domain Team Descriptions

- **Oracle Teams** are responsible for designing oracle feed mechanisms for new collateral types, compelling the oracles to upgrade their nodes with new price feeds for new collateral types via MIP10, and creating the oracle work product for collateral onboarding.
- **Smart Contracts Teams** are responsible for developing and deploying the collateral adapter for new collateral onboarding, and creating the technical work product for collateral onboarding proposals.
- **Risk Teams** are responsible for creating the risk construct for a collateral onboarding proposal. As a part of the collateral on-boarding process, they also need to get a general model ratified on which they can base their risk construct.
- **Legal Teams** are in some cases necessary for collateral onboarding, when dealing with assets that have legal claims attached to them. They create the legal work product for collateral onboarding.

### MIP7c3: Domain Team Onboarding

MIP7c3 is a Process MIP component that allows the onboarding of a domain team using a subproposal. 

If onboarded through a MIP7c3 subproposal, the domain team is added to the The Current Domain Team Roles list defined in MIP7c2 by a MIP Editor.

MIP7c3 subproposals have the following parameters:
-   **Feedback Period**: 3 months
-   **Frozen Period**: 1 month

MIP7c3 subproposals must use the template located at  **[MIP7c3-Subproposal-Template.md](MIP7c3-Subproposal-Template.md)**. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.

### MIP7c4: Domain Team offboarding

MIP7c4 is a Process MIP component that allows the removal of a domain team using a subproposal.

If offboarded through a MIP7c4 subproposal the domain team is removed from the Current Domain Team Roles list defined in MIP7c2 by a MIP Editor.

 MIP7c4 subproposals have the following parameters:
-   **Feedback Period**: 0 days
-   **Frozen Period**: 0 days

MIP7c4 subproposals must use the template located at  **[MIP7c4-Subproposal-Template.md](MIP7c4-Subproposal-Template.md)**. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.
