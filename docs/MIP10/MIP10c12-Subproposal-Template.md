## Specification

### Introduction
- What is the problem with our current Oracle Access Fee?
- Why do we need a new Oracle Access Fee?

### Oracle Access Fee Model Strategy
- How does the proposed model work?
	- Is it based on a strategy to grow the customer base?
	- Is it based on a strategy to reign in costs to a more sustainable business model?
	- Is it based on a loss-leader strategy to strengthen the brand of the Maker Protocol?
	- How are prices applied across different Oracles and different customers?
	- Is it a flat-fee applied uniformly across every Oracle and customer?
	- Is it applied to how much value a customer derives from the Oracle?
	- Is it dependent on how many Oracles a customer is whitelisted on?
	- Is it dependent on how many customers use a particular Oracle?
	- Is it dependent on how long a customer has used our Oracles?
	- Is it dependent on the type of data the Oracle is broadcasting?
	- Is it dependent on the Oracle Spread / Oracle Expiration Time of the Oracle?
	- Does the price differ if the customer is also a Light Feed?
	- Does the price differ between the Medianizer and Oracle Security Module? What if a customer wants both?
	- Are fees waived for certain classes of customers? Why?
	- Are prices dependent on what our competitors charge?
- How many customers are expected to be lost or gained due to this change in pricing?
