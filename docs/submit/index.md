# Submitting MIPs and Sub-proposals

This page provides all the information you need to understand what kinds of sub-proposals you can submit based on the [currently active MIP set](../accepted).

It also provides the different templates you'll require, not just for each different kind of sub-proposal, but for submitting entirely new Governance and Technical MIPs.
