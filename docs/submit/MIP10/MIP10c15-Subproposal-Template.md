## Specification

### Introduction

### Dark Feeds
**Experience**

*include revised experience template from MIP10c13 for all info that could be verified by the Oracle Team*

- Of the claims made, which ones could be verified, which ones could not?
- Was the proposer able to sign a message with their private key for their roles?
- Could the start date and role duration be verified through an immutable blockchain?
- Is/are the role duration(s) significant enough in length to point to a theme of longstanding responsible behavior? 
- Is there a way to analyse the historic uptime of the miner / validator?
- Was the hash rate or tokens staked significant enough in magnitude to require significant investment?
- What is the relationship between the fractional stake or hash power relative to the total stake / hash power of the network.
- Is there any evidence this individual ever participated in malicious behavior in their role(s)?

**Identity**
- Was the Oracle Team able to find any personally identifiable information linking the applicant to their roles?
- Is it likely given the information provided that there are individuals who could identify this person? What order of magnitude?

### Light Feeds
**Reputation*
- Does the organization have a strong reputation in the crypto community?
- What contributions has this organization made to the crypto ecosystem?
- Would including the organization as a Light Feed instill a sense of trust in the Oracles?
- Are there any public accussations of misconduct? How severe and numerous are they? Have they been confirmed?

**Verification** 
- Were sufficient public-facing resources provided or found that confirm the information in the application?
- Was the applicant honest with respect to:
	- the investors
	- how much funding was raised
	- the number of employees
	- the location of incorporation & domicile
- Given the applicant's major investors, is there a risk adding this Light Feed would give a single investor too much influence over the Oracle protocol?
- Given the incorporation and domicile location of the organization, is there a risk adding this Light Feed would give a single jurisdiction too much influence over the Oracle protocol?

**Identity*
- Did the Oracle Team get in contact with the organization to confirm their application?

### Cost-Benefit
- Given the ratio of Dark Feeds : Light Feeds, does the Maker Protocol benefit from adding another Dark/Light Feed at this time?
- Given the extra cost of appointing a new Feed, does the benefit of the marginal security / marginal trust in the protocol exceed the cost?

### Oracle Team Reccomendation
- was the applicant honest with the data they provided?

### Changelog
- List of updates
