## Specification

### Introduction
- What is the problem with the current Feed Stipend?
- Why is a new Feed Stipend needed?

### Feed Stipend Model
- How does the proposed model work?
	- Is the Feed Stipend static or dynamic?
	- Is it a flat amount for all Feeds?
	- Do Dark Feeds and Light Feeds get paid different amounts?
	- Is the amount based on seniority?
	- Should the amount be raised to increase security?
	- Should the amount be lowered to reduce costs?
	- Is the Feed Stipend higher for Feeds exhibiting higher than average uptime and lower for Feeds exhibiting lower than average uptime?
	- Is the Feed Stipend proportional to the Dai supply?
	- Is the Feed Stipend proportional to the value of locked collateral?
	- Is the Feed Stipend inversely proportional to the number of Feeds?
	- Is the Feed Stipend proportional to the amount of stability fees?
