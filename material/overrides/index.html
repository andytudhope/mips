								<p>The Maker Improvement Proposal Framework is a tool to provide a clear, transparent process that allows Maker governance to adapt and evolve the Protocol as needs and circumstances dictate far into the future.</p>
								<p>MIPs are the preferred mechanism for improving Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol. Through an open and documented process, the goal is to collect as much community feedback as possible and reach the broadest possible consensus on how the Maker Protocol should evolve. A proposal clearly defines how and why Maker Governance or the Maker Protocol should be changed and ensures that the proposed improvement is introduced in a responsible way, respecting the highest quality, security and community standards. In most cases, MIPs will be arranged in sets (multiple MIPs that are interdependent but together solve a single problem, risk, or opportunity through one or more processes).</p>
								<p>MIPs are critical to the evolution of the current Maker governance process and must, therefore, be rigidly structured and formalized to avoid any ambiguity. Providing the community with a standard approach to proposing improvements, specifications, and process and state changes enables organic growth that will bring MakerDAO closer to self-sustainability.</p>
								<p>MIPs are first discussed on <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our forum</a> before being added to this site by means of a Pull Request to the <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/mips/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">GithUb Repo</a>.</p>
