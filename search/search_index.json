Conception: The lifecycle of a MIP begins when the MIP proposal is posted on the Maker forum. However, in order for a MIP to move to the next stage, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria (1) described below: Submitted to the MIPs Discourse Forum. Submitted to the MIPs Github repository (with a Pull Request created by the MIP Author or MIP Editor). The format must follow the appropriate MIP Template for its type. MIPs must be original or replacement versions of older MIPs (No repeats allowed). 2. Approved by MIP Editor(s): This phase of a MIP\u2019s life cycle is when the MIP Editor(s) confirms that the proposed MIP follows the correct structure and editorial criteria defined in the MIP template. If the criteria is not met, the MIP Editor(s) will provide an explanation to the MIP Author as to why and allow them to make the appropriate changes before reconsideration. If the criteria have been met, the MIP Editor(s) performs the following actions: The MIP is approved by a MIP Editor(s) and is assigned a formal MIP number. The PR is merged in by a MIP Editor(s). 3. Request for Comments (RFC): This phase is when a MIP goes through a formal review period, including feedback from the community, further drafting and additions. The timeline for the RFC phase is defined by its Feedback Period and Frozen Period. In order to move to the next phase, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria listed below: MIP Author finalizes changes of the MIP, based on community feedback. MIPs have a Feedback Period of 3 months. The RFC phase lasts at least 3 months before the MIP can move to the next phase. MIPs have a Frozen Period of 1 month. MIPs must not have had any changes for the last 1 month before they move to the next phase. 4. Fulfilled Feedback Period Requirements: This status is given once the MIP has fulfilled the defined Feedback Period and Frozen Period. After the MIP has waited out its Feedback Period and Frozen Period, it\u2019s ready for Formal Submission. Note that the Feedback Period and Frozen Period can overlap. 5. Formal Submission (FS) - This phase is when MIP Authors submit their complete MIP(s) to the Governance cycle by posting it to the formal submission forum category within the formal submission window of a governance cycle. - A MIP can be re-submitted to the formal submission process a maximum of 2 additional times (3 total), without having to go through phase 1- 4 again, if it failed to pass due to legitimate external reasons (e.g. got bundled in a governance poll or executive vote with a controversial proposal - subject to the governance facilitators judgement). 6. Approved by the Governance Facilitator(s) : This phase is when the MIP must be formally approved by the Governance Facilitators. Once approved by the Governance Facilitator, the MIP will be included in the inclusion poll of the Governance cycle. If the MIP is not approved by the Governance Facilitator, it may be reconsidered at a later date to enter the Governance cycle. 7. Governance Cycle : This phase is when MKR holders vote on whether to include the MIP in the governance poll, ultimately determining whether or not the MIP can formally enter the governance cycle. - Once approved for the governance poll, MKR holders determine whether to accept or reject the package of proposals in the governance poll and finally to ratify the result in the executive vote. 8. Executive Vote: This phase is when the MIP becomes officially ratified or not. Determined by MKR holders, the executive vote ultimately accepts or rejects the MIP. 9. Accepted/Rejected: The Executive vote results in either acceptance or rejection of the MIP. If passed, the MIP is officially accepted and is given the accepted status. If the executive vote fails to pass before expiring, the MIP is rejected. - As described in phase 5, a rejected MIP, can be resubmitted, and in some cases (if it was rejected for provable extraneous explanation) may be allowed to enter the next Governance cycle immediately. Other MIP Statuses Withdrawn : when a MIP Author withdraws their MIP proposal, such as when: A MIP may be withdrawn at any point before it enters the Governance cycle. Note that a withdrawn proposal can be taken over from the original Author with a simple transition facilitated by a MIP Editor(s) and the respective parties. If the original MIP Author ceases to be available, the MIP Editor(s) may proceed with the transfer of Authors. Deferred : when a proposal has been deemed as not ready or not a priority but can be re-proposed at a later date. - Request for Comments (RFC) - Forum poll/signal request rejects a MIP Proposal. Obsolete : when a proposal is no longer used or is out of date, such as: A MIP is replaced with a new proposal. A MIP has been deferred for over 6 months. A MIP Author has abandoned the proposal and no person has communicated willingness to take over MIP Author responsibility. A MIP has been replaced by a newer, more updated MIP Proposal. A MIP no longer makes sense to keep in consideration. MIP Status Change Process A status change for a MIP is requested by the MIP Author and will be reviewed by the MIP Editor(s) to see if it meets the status criteria of the requested status change. If it does, the Editor(s) will change the status of the MIP and the Author may proceed with the next stage of the process. If it does not, the MIP Editor(s) will revert with highlighted issues, and the Author must fix the highlighted issues before requesting another status change.","title":"Status"},{"location":"status/#mip-statuses","text":"MIP \u2116 Date Proposed Proposal Link Description/Title Status 0 2020-04-06 MIP0 Maker Improvement Proposals Framework RFC 1 2020-04-06 MIP1 Governance Paradigms RFC 2 2020-04-06 MIP2 Launch Period RFC 3 2020-04-06 MIP3 Governance Cycle RFC 4 2020-04-06 MIP4 MIP Amendment and Removal Process RFC 5 2020-04-06 MIP5 Emergency Voting System RFC 6 2020-04-06 MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Form/Forum Template RFC 7 2020-04-06 MIP7 Domain Teams (Collateral Onboarding) RFC 8 2020-04-06 MIP8 Domain Greenlight (Collateral Onboarding) RFC 9 2020-04-06 MIP9 Community Greenlight (Collateral Onboarding) RFC 10 2020-04-06 MIP10 Oracle Management RFC 11 2020-04-06 MIP11 General Risk Model Management (Collateral Onboarding) RFC 12 2020-04-06 MIP12 Collateral and Risk Parameter Management RFC","title":"MIP Statuses"},{"location":"status/#the-mip-lifecycle","text":"","title":"The MIP Lifecycle"},{"location":"status/#mip-status-criterion","text":"1.

Motivation In the Maker Protocol, every collateral type has a corresponding Oracle that publishes a reference price that the protocol utilizes. Therefore, the Oracle requirements must be laid out in detail for the collateral onboarding process. Governance may also choose to create Oracles for non-collateral assets for use by 3 rd parties.

Motivation Risk models are a crucial element of the Maker Protocol's maintenance and growth. The models provide a representation of how a risk team intends to evaluate an asset or other part of the risk function. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to create a defined and formalized process for Risk teams to more easily onboard their models to the Maker Protocol and ultimately help grow and maintain the Protocol. Specification / Proposal Details MIP11 Components MIP11c1: General Risk Model Requirements MIP11c2: List of Active General Risk Models MIP11c3: Process for Onboarding MIP11c4: Process for offboarding MIP11c1: General Risk Model Requirements Description: A general model provides a representation of how a risk team intends to evaluate an asset or another part of the risk function. This can help determine which assets should be given priority as approved assets make their way into the collateral pool. A general model acts as a natural filtration mechanism where collateral types are ranked against one another for prioritization purposes. A general model must contain a quantitative risk methodology for the evaluation of risk parameters. Optionally, it can also contain: A qualitative framework that describes the process for evaluating the fundamentals of a proposed collateral asset A scoring framework for collateral assets that enables a standardized approach for converting qualitative analysis into numerical outputs. This is achieved through a ratings-based methodology.

Motivation This proposal aims to layout one part of the generalized process for adding collateral types to the Maker Protocol. This will allow the community to get an idea of what the applying collateral is, an overview of the risks, and an understanding of the potential benefits to Maker. A consistent application form allows prospective collateral types to be compared by the community. The pitch materials allow the interested party to generate interest from the Maker community. Although this is only one component of the overall collateral onboarding process, this proposed standard would decrease confusion surrounding how to start the process of getting collateral added to the Maker Protocol and ultimately, increase the onboarding speed at which new collateral types can be onboarded.

Additionally, the interested party may organize an optional call to pitch their proposal as well as open up further discussion to the community. Once the application has been submitted to the forum, it is eligible for Domain team review and can, therefore, move forward in the collateral onboarding process. Overall Process Overview Diagram MIP6c2: Application Form Template Responses to these questions serve as an introduction to the community, this minimum set of information helps intrigued community members research the project on their own. Other pitch materials of all sorts are encouraged if the applicant believes it will help them garner support and excitement for the collateral. The suggested application questions are as follows: Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Provide a brief history of the project Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses.

Link to any active communities relating to your project. How is the applying collateral type currently used? Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Where does exchange for the asset occur? (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.

Motivation The goal of this proposal is to inform the community about the pre-evaluation stage with the aim of identifying any show-stopping problems before time is spent on a full evaluation of the collateral type. Specification / Proposal Details In this stage, the domain teams will signal that they believe the collateral type is worth the time to perform a full evaluation in their respective domain. Note that this stage may happen in parallel to the MIP6 process, but communication from the Domain teams should always come within two weeks of the end of the allotted review time for MIP6's collateral onboarding form/forum publication. MIP8 Components MIP8c1: The Domain Greenlight Requirements and Process MIP8c1: The Domain Greenlight Requirements and Process If unresolvable issues arise with a specific domain, that domain team is responsible for communicating that they have rejected the collateral type to both the interested party and the community via the Maker forums. The domain team will provide a reason for rejection as part of this communication. If resolvable issues arise with a specific domain, that domain team is responsible for communicating that the collateral is on-hold to both the interested party, and to the community via the Maker forums. This communication will include an explanation for the change in status and the criteria that should be met before they resume work. If there are no issues that warrant stopping this process, then each domain team is responsible for communicating that they are happy to proceed to a full evaluation. This is done by a member of each type of domain team making a forum reply to the MIP6 collateral application forum post saying they have done a MIP8 review and found no issues. In case new information becomes available that changes the assessment of a domain team, they can revoke their greenlight by posting that they are revoking it in the same forum post. This will then prevent the asset from being considered for collateral onboarding, or participating in any more community greenlight polls, even if they have already been in some. If domain greenlight fails from one or multiple domain teams, it does not prevent the asset from being considered for collateral onboarding. It only prevents it from being onboarded if there is not an alternative team in that domain willing to greenlight it. Key Outcomes If no issues are raised, the process continues in parallel with or past MIP9 (Community Greenlight). If put on-hold a resumption criterion is defined and communicated clearly. Once all on-hold criteria are met, the process continues to MIP9 (Community Greenlight).

This communication will include an explanation for the change in status and the criteria that should be met before they resume work. If there are no issues that warrant stopping this process, then each domain team is responsible for communicating that they are happy to proceed to a full evaluation. This is done by a member of each type of domain team making a forum reply to the MIP6 collateral application forum post saying they have done a MIP8 review and found no issues. In case new information becomes available that changes the assessment of a domain team, they can revoke their greenlight by posting that they are revoking it in the same forum post. This will then prevent the asset from being considered for collateral onboarding, or participating in any more community greenlight polls, even if they have already been in some. If domain greenlight fails from one or multiple domain teams, it does not prevent the asset from being considered for collateral onboarding. It only prevents it from being onboarded if there is not an alternative team in that domain willing to greenlight it.

The preferences of the MKR Token holders are expressed in the form of an on-chain governance poll. The governance poll (Greenlight poll) runs at the end of the governance cycle and will run for a period of two weeks. Motivation While domain teams are free to choose their own workload, an on-chain governance poll provides the Domain Teams key insights into the community's sentiment for each collateral type that has been proposed. In addition to this, it is important to gather the opinion of MKR Token Holders towards the proposed collateral asset before the full domain work takes place. This helps prevent work from being wasted on undesirable collateral types. Specification / Proposal Details In this stage, the Governance Facilitator (GF) will create an on-chain governance poll in the template format defined in MIP9c2 and the community will vote with their preferences. MIP9 Components MIP9c1: The Community Greenlight Requirements and Process MIP9c2: Governance Poll Template MIP9c1: The Community Greenlight Requirements and Process The process begins when an interested party (collateral type proposer) informs the Governance Facilitator(s) that the collateral application process has reached the Community Greenlight phase. The collateral form (MIP6) has been submitted to the forum and/or has received Domain Greenlight approval (MIP8) from each of the domain teams (smart contracts, risk and oracles). From then on, the Governance Facilitator(s) are responsible for creating a Community Greenlight Poll for the collateral type in question. Note that an individual approval poll is created for each collateral asset. This poll will use the format defined in MIP9c2 (Governance Poll Template), using ETH as an example collateral type. The greenlight polls happen at a fixed time each governance cycle, from the 4 th Monday of the month to the 4 th Friday of the month. The Governance Facilitator(s) are responsible for maintaining a list of collaterals based on the outcome of the individual Community Greenlight Polls. This list should include collateral types that have both passed and failed to pass their Community Greenlight Polls. The collateral assets in the polls will be listed and ranked based on their score. As noted above (3), the list includes the collateral types that have both passed and failed to pass in the Community Greenlight Polls. It's important to include assets that have failed (negative score) to still be considered based on the domain teams judgment call, because you could have situations where competitors are trying to use MKR to suppress each other's assets in order to get a competitive edge and thus, unfairly put them at a disadvantage by denying them funding from Maker. Any collateral asset that has passed MIP8, and not had any of its MIP8 greenlight approvals revoked again, including assets that have already had a greenlight poll before, will be included in the MIP9 community greenlight polls, except when for technical reasons there is not enough capacity to hold all the votes, in which case the governance facilitator decides the most important assets to include, prioritizing those that haven't had a vote before. Important Note: MIP9 may happen in parallel with MIP8 (Domain Greenlight). Key Outcomes from the Governance Poll Once the Community Greenlight Poll is complete. The Domain teams proceed to perform their respective work defined in their mandates. Example: The Smart contracts team will build the collateral adaptor and the risk team will build their risk construct for the specified collateral type. If the Community Greenlight Poll passes and Domain Greenlight (MIP8) fails in one or more domains, the community must find a substitute for the rejecting domain teams before this process can proceed. If the Community Greenlight Poll fails the Domain teams are free to work on the collateral if they hold confidence that governance will approve it in the future.

This includes the core components and statuses as well as the various MIP types and the overall MIP lifecycle. Furthermore, it provides the necessary tools, such as MIP templates, replacement processes, and dependencies. Lastly, the proposal details the key roles of the framework, the MIP Editor and the Governance Facilitator along with the process for adding and removing them. Motivation MakerDAO is evolving into an organization that is trustless, fully decentralized, open-sourced, and self-sustainable. In order to further enable this gradual evolution while maintaining governance functionality both during this process and after the dissolution of the Maker Foundation, Maker will be governed using Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs). The purpose of the MIPs Framework is to open up the ability to improve Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol to anyone in the community. By empowering the participation of the community and other stakeholders to have a standard approach to proposing improvements, specifications, or process and state changes, the goal is to enable organic growth that will in turn bring MakerDAO closer to self-sustainability. In order for MIPs to be functional they need to comply with a basic standard outlining their internal structure and external dependencies. This standard is MIPs described in MIP0, the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework. Specification / Proposal Details MIP0 Components MIP0c1: Definitions of the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework MIP0c2: Three Core Principles MIP0c3: The MIP Lifecycle MIP0c4: MIP Components and MIP Component Types MIP0c5: MIP Replacement Process MIP0c6: MIP Templates MIP0c7: MIP0 Domain Role Dependencies MIP0c8: MIP Editor Election Process MIP0c9: MIP Editor Removal Process MIP0c10: Governance Facilitator Election Process MIP0c11: Governance Facilitator Removal Process MIP0c1: Definitions of the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) are the preferred mechanism for improving Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol. Through an open and documented process, the goal is to collect as much community feedback as possible and reach the broadest possible consensus on how the Maker Protocol should evolve. A proposal clearly defines how and why Maker Governance or the Maker Protocol should be changed and ensures that this improvement is introduced in a responsible way, respecting the highest quality, security and community standards. MIP0: The genesis MIP defining the MIPs framework. This MIP defines all of the processes that are required for the implementation of future MIPs. MIP Sets: A MIP set is a group of several MIPs that are interdependent, in which without the entire set of MIPs existing, one or more MIPs in the Set become inconsistent, invalid or nonsensical. The intention is for MIP sets to together describe a single complex behaviour in such a way that allows each individual MIP to be written following the principle of Specificity but work together as a cohesive modular whole. MIP Types: MIPs are separated into a number of types, and each type has its own list of MIPs and processes. Process MIP: Process MIPs are used to create and define a specific recurring process that the Maker Protocol or Governance will employ. Subproposals (SPs): A subproposal is an instance of a sub-process that has been defined by a specific MIP. Subproposals are named in the following format: MIP0-SP1 (where MIP0 is a Process MIP and MIP0-SP1 is a subproposal under that Process MIP) Minimum Feedback Period: The minimum amount of time within which the community is able to give feedback in response to a proposed MIP. Minimum Frozen Period: The minimum amount of time during which a MIP must remain unchanged (frozen) before it can be submitted for ratification/implementation. Governance Facilitator(s): Governance Facilitators are tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities, anything from general administration to signals gathering to governance scheduling. MIP Editor(s): Enforce the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and program. The expectation is that the program will start out with an interim editor from the Maker Foundation and that others will join later. Domain Teams : Domain Teams work for the DAO, are onboarded through governance and are paid by the Protocol. Domain teams perform defined duties for the DAO, such as overseeing critical processes and mitigating risk. These teams consist of but are not limited to Risk, Oracles, Smart Contracts or Legal. MIP0c2: Three Core Principles Specificity: A MIP needs to define and address a specific behaviour or single responsibility. MIPs with many different behaviours or responsibilities will not be allowed and must be split up into multiple MIPs. This mitigates the risk of having \u201cfine print\u201d or potential attacks hidden in large, complex MIPs. Completeness: A MIP or MIP Set is complete if it has all the necessary or appropriate parts that cover a whole behaviour and avoids being only a specific part of a greater whole. This is important for both understandability, readability and accessibility of MIPs. Avoid overlap: Multiple MIPs should not implement the same type of behaviour independently. For instance, there should not be two separate but interchangeable ways to do collateral onboarding. This way the primary and best-understood process for each particular behaviour will be fairly available to everyone, without risking having a knowledge gap that makes it possible for some actors with better access to information to use different and potentially better processes MIP0c3: The MIP Lifecycle The MIP Lifecycle Flow and MIP Statuses MIP Status Criteria 1. Conception: The lifecycle of a MIP begins when the MIP proposal is posted on the Maker forum. However, in order for a MIP to move to the next stage, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria (1) described below: Submitted to the MIPs Discourse Forum. Submitted to the MIPs Github repository (with a Pull Request created by the MIP Author or MIP Editor). The format must follow the appropriate MIP Template for its type. MIPs must be original or replacement versions of older MIPs (No repeats allowed). 2. Approved by MIP Editor(s): This phase of a MIP\u2019s life cycle is when the MIP Editor(s) confirms that the proposed MIP follows the correct structure and editorial criteria defined in the MIP template. If the criteria is not met, the MIP Editor(s) will provide an explanation to the MIP Author as to why and allow them to make the appropriate changes before reconsideration. If the criteria have been met, the MIP Editor(s) performs the following actions: The MIP is approved by a MIP Editor(s) and is assigned a formal MIP number. The PR is merged in by a MIP Editor(s). 3. Request for Comments (RFC): This phase is when a MIP goes through a formal review period, including feedback from the community, further drafting and additions. The timeline for the RFC phase is defined by its Feedback Period and Frozen Period. In order to move to the next phase, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria listed below: MIP Author finalizes changes of the MIP, based on community feedback. MIPs have a Feedback Period of 3 months. The RFC phase lasts at least 3 months before the MIP can move to the next phase. MIPs have a Frozen Period of 1 month. MIPs must not have had any changes for the last 1 month before they move to the next phase. 4. Fulfilled Feedback Period Requirements: This status is given once the MIP has fulfilled the defined Feedback Period and Frozen Period. After the MIP has waited out its Feedback Period and Frozen Period, it\u2019s ready for Formal Submission. Note that the Feedback Period and Frozen Period can overlap. 5. Formal Submission (FS) - This phase is when MIP Authors submit their complete MIP(s) to the Governance cycle by posting it to the formal submission forum category within the formal submission window of a governance cycle. - A MIP can be re-submitted to the formal submission process a maximum of 2 additional times (3 total), without having to go through phase 1- 4 again, if it failed to pass due to legitimate external reasons (e.g. got bundled in a governance poll or executive vote with a controversial proposal - subject to the governance facilitators judgement). 6. Approved by the Governance Facilitator(s) : This phase is when the MIP must be formally approved by the Governance Facilitators. Once approved by the Governance Facilitator, the MIP will be included in the inclusion poll of the Governance cycle. If the MIP is not approved by the Governance Facilitator, it may be reconsidered at a later date to enter the Governance cycle. 7. Governance Cycle : This phase is when MKR holders vote on whether to include the MIP in the governance poll, ultimately determining whether or not the MIP can formally enter the governance cycle. - Once approved for the governance poll, MKR holders determine whether to accept or reject the package of proposals in the governance poll and finally to ratify the result in the executive vote. 8. Executive Vote: This phase is when the MIP becomes officially ratified or not. Determined by MKR holders, the executive vote ultimately accepts or rejects the MIP. 9. Accepted/Rejected: The Executive vote results in either acceptance or rejection of the MIP. If passed, the MIP is officially accepted and is given the accepted status. If the executive vote fails to pass before expiring, the MIP is rejected. - As described in phase 5, a rejected MIP, can be resubmitted, and in some cases (if it was rejected for provable extraneous explanation) may be allowed to enter the next Governance cycle immediately. Other MIP Statuses: Withdrawn : when a MIP Author withdraws their MIP proposal, such as when: A MIP may be withdrawn at any point before it enters the Governance cycle. Note that a withdrawn proposal can be taken over from the original Author with a simple transition facilitated by a MIP Editor(s) and the respective parties. If the original MIP Author ceases to be available, the MIP Editor(s) may proceed with the transfer of Authors. Deferred : when a proposal has been deemed as not ready or not a priority but can be re-proposed at a later date. - Request for Comments (RFC) - Forum poll/signal request rejects a MIP Proposal. Obsolete : when a proposal is no longer used or is out of date, such as: A MIP is replaced with a new proposal. A MIP has been deferred for over 6 months. A MIP Author has abandoned the proposal and no person has communicated willingness to take over MIP Author responsibility. A MIP has been replaced by a newer, more updated MIP Proposal. A MIP no longer makes sense to keep in consideration. MIP Status Change Process: A status change for a MIP is requested by the MIP Author and will be reviewed by the MIP Editor(s) to see if it meets the status criteria of the requested status change. If it does, the Editor(s) will change the status of the MIP and the Author may proceed with the next stage of the process. If it does not, the MIP Editor(s) will revert with highlighted issues, and the Author must fix the highlighted issues before requesting another status change. MIP0c4: MIP Components and MIP Component Types MIP Components When necessary, MIPs can have multiple components if it needs to contain multiple units of logic to satisfy completeness. A MIP can also have only a single component. MIP components are categorized by types, depending on what kind of logic they contain. MIP components are named by their parent MIP. The abbreviation convention MIPXcY is used to refer to these components (as seen in this document). A MIP component has one type or no types. Note: MIP0's MIP Components are introduced at the beginning of the Specification section. Component Types Technical MIP Components Summary: The purpose of technical MIP components is to perform state changes to the Maker Protocol. Specific Template: Technical MIPs are based on the General MIP Template but must include the following additional information in their specification section: Proposed Code Audited, final code that can be used directly in the executive vote to accept or reject the MIP. Test Cases Test cases for the implementation or testing of the proposed code Security Considerations The purpose of this section is to proactively document any security-relevant design information, decisions, potential failure modes, implementation details, and important discussions related to the proposed change. Backwards compatibility Auditor Information and Report This section includes the audit partner details and the final audit report for the proposed code. License Process MIP Component Summary: The purpose of a Process MIP component is to shape a specific process flow for the Maker community to adopt and standardize with respect to how governance operates. This MIP component type helps streamline specific processes in a transparent, open and traceable manner. A Process MIP will provide a publicly documented scope of a proposed process framework as well as a detailed description of the subproposal structure. Special Template: N/A Important Notes: A Process MIP component must define the Feedback Period and Frozen Period for its sub proposals. Sub proposals of Process MIP components with additional MIP Component types inherit the same types. Sub Proposals Summary: A MIP component creates a bespoke process that is engaged by submitting sup proposals according to the framework specified in the process MIP component. The subproposal component naming convention is MIP#c#-SP# . This is important in order to delineate between different SPs under the same MIP. Special Template: N/A MIP0c5: MIP Replacement Process A MIP can define one or more replacement targets in its preamble. If the MIP is given the accepted status, the replacement target(s) MIPs then receive the Obsolete status and effectively become inactive. The replaced MIP will in its MIP document contain the number of the MIP that replaced it, and other MIPs that depend on the replaced MIP, will instead interact with the new MIP. Due to the fact that the dependencies carry over, a MIP with defined replacement targets must, in order to be valid, strictly adhere to dependency requirements and interface correctly with MIPs that depend on the replaced MIP, and thus after the replacement with the new MIP. MIP0c6: MIP Templates General MIP Template Technical MIP Template MIP0c7: MIP0 Domain Role Dependencies The MIPs Framework depends on these types of Domain Roles: MIP Editor(s): Enforces the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and program. The expectation is that the program will start out with an interim editor from the Maker Foundation and that others will join later. Specific authority of the MIP Editor(s) in MIP0 processes: The MIP Editor(s) controls phase 2 of the MIP lifecycle and can assign MIP numbers The MIP Editor(s) is an admin on the MIPs Github repository The MIP Editor(s) is a moderator on the MIPs Discourse forum The MIP Editor(s) is responsible for updating the status of MIPs, as described in MIP0c4 \u201cThe MIP Lifecycle\u201d. Governance Facilitator: Operates voting frontends, runs governance meetings and accepts MIPs that are ready to be included in the Governance Cycle and thus, voted on. Specific authority of the Governance Facilitator in MIP0 processes: Consensus from all governance facilitators controls phase 6 of the MIP lifecycle, which allows them to, with consensus, add valid MIPs to the inclusion poll of the next governance cycle, moving them from phase 5 (formal submission) to phase 7 (governance cycle). MIP0c8: MIP Editor Election Process Description of MIP Editor Role : The MIP Editor enforces the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and framework. This includes: Maintain and manage mips.makerdao.com. Provide feedback and have discussions in the MIP section of forum.makerdao.com (ex: helping vet proposal ideas). MIPs processing. Enforcing the proper MIPs process with responsibilities such as: Confirm that the title accurately describes the content of the proposal. Confirm there is a (real) dedicated author, coordinator, funder and/or sponsor, etc. of the MIP. Assign proposed MIP's formal number labels. Change MIP statuses. Correct MIP category placement. Correspond with MIP authors/coordinators. Review the MIP for obvious defects in the language (format, completeness, spelling, grammar, sentence structure) and that it follows the style guide (template). MIP Editors are allowed to correct problems themselves, but are not required to do so and can send comments to authors to improve it themselves. Work and communicate with Governance Facilitators on coordinating governance and executive votes in relation to MIPs and the governance cycle. Onboard and vet new MIP Editors. The expectation is that the system will start out with an interim editor from the Maker Foundation and that others will join later. A MIP Editor must be vetted by the current MIP Editor(s) and by MKR holders through this sub proposal. Once an Editor, they will be added to Github and subscribed to watching the MIP repository. They will also become a moderator in the MIPs Rocket.Chat Channel and the MIPs Forum. Much of the correspondence regarding MIPs will be handled through GitHub as well in the MakerDAO forums. MIP Editor Selection Criteria A complete understanding of the MIPs Framework Knowledge share will occur when onboarded but the candidate must be very familiar with the framework and how other improvement proposal frameworks operate. Required to be a community member for some time. This can be shown through various proof of participation methods, such as: Past forum posts Attendance of community and governance calls Articles written about Maker or Dai Familiarity with the technical inner workings of the Maker Protocol (bonus) Experience with Github Merging, editing, closing Pull Requests Addressing issues Adding tags / labels Experience with the Markdown language MIPs will be written in Markdown, so editors will need to be familiar with the language.

By empowering the participation of the community and other stakeholders to have a standard approach to proposing improvements, specifications, or process and state changes, the goal is to enable organic growth that will in turn bring MakerDAO closer to self-sustainability.

Through an open and documented process, the goal is to collect as much community feedback as possible and reach the broadest possible consensus on how the Maker Protocol should evolve. A proposal clearly defines how and why Maker Governance or the Maker Protocol should be changed and ensures that this improvement is introduced in a responsible way, respecting the highest quality, security and community standards. MIP0: The genesis MIP defining the MIPs framework. This MIP defines all of the processes that are required for the implementation of future MIPs. MIP Sets: A MIP set is a group of several MIPs that are interdependent, in which without the entire set of MIPs existing, one or more MIPs in the Set become inconsistent, invalid or nonsensical. The intention is for MIP sets to together describe a single complex behaviour in such a way that allows each individual MIP to be written following the principle of Specificity but work together as a cohesive modular whole. MIP Types: MIPs are separated into a number of types, and each type has its own list of MIPs and processes. Process MIP: Process MIPs are used to create and define a specific recurring process that the Maker Protocol or Governance will employ. Subproposals (SPs): A subproposal is an instance of a sub-process that has been defined by a specific MIP. Subproposals are named in the following format: MIP0-SP1 (where MIP0 is a Process MIP and MIP0-SP1 is a subproposal under that Process MIP) Minimum Feedback Period: The minimum amount of time within which the community is able to give feedback in response to a proposed MIP. Minimum Frozen Period: The minimum amount of time during which a MIP must remain unchanged (frozen) before it can be submitted for ratification/implementation. Governance Facilitator(s): Governance Facilitators are tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities, anything from general administration to signals gathering to governance scheduling. MIP Editor(s): Enforce the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and program. The expectation is that the program will start out with an interim editor from the Maker Foundation and that others will join later. Domain Teams : Domain Teams work for the DAO, are onboarded through governance and are paid by the Protocol. Domain teams perform defined duties for the DAO, such as overseeing critical processes and mitigating risk. These teams consist of but are not limited to Risk, Oracles, Smart Contracts or Legal.","title":"MIP0c1: Definitions of the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework"},{"location":"core-governance/mip0/#mip0c2-three-core-principles","text":"Specificity: A MIP needs to define and address a specific behaviour or single responsibility. MIPs with many different behaviours or responsibilities will not be allowed and must be split up into multiple MIPs. This mitigates the risk of having \u201cfine print\u201d or potential attacks hidden in large, complex MIPs. Completeness: A MIP or MIP Set is complete if it has all the necessary or appropriate parts that cover a whole behaviour and avoids being only a specific part of a greater whole. This is important for both understandability, readability and accessibility of MIPs. Avoid overlap: Multiple MIPs should not implement the same type of behaviour independently. For instance, there should not be two separate but interchangeable ways to do collateral onboarding. This way the primary and best-understood process for each particular behaviour will be fairly available to everyone, without risking having a knowledge gap that makes it possible for some actors with better access to information to use different and potentially better processes","title":"MIP0c2: Three Core Principles"},{"location":"core-governance/mip0/#mip0c3-the-mip-lifecycle","text":"The MIP Lifecycle Flow and MIP Statuses MIP Status Criteria 1. Conception: The lifecycle of a MIP begins when the MIP proposal is posted on the Maker forum. However, in order for a MIP to move to the next stage, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria (1) described below: Submitted to the MIPs Discourse Forum. Submitted to the MIPs Github repository (with a Pull Request created by the MIP Author or MIP Editor). The format must follow the appropriate MIP Template for its type. MIPs must be original or replacement versions of older MIPs (No repeats allowed). 2. Approved by MIP Editor(s): This phase of a MIP\u2019s life cycle is when the MIP Editor(s) confirms that the proposed MIP follows the correct structure and editorial criteria defined in the MIP template. If the criteria is not met, the MIP Editor(s) will provide an explanation to the MIP Author as to why and allow them to make the appropriate changes before reconsideration. If the criteria have been met, the MIP Editor(s) performs the following actions: The MIP is approved by a MIP Editor(s) and is assigned a formal MIP number. The PR is merged in by a MIP Editor(s). 3. Request for Comments (RFC): This phase is when a MIP goes through a formal review period, including feedback from the community, further drafting and additions. The timeline for the RFC phase is defined by its Feedback Period and Frozen Period. In order to move to the next phase, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria listed below: MIP Author finalizes changes of the MIP, based on community feedback. MIPs have a Feedback Period of 3 months. The RFC phase lasts at least 3 months before the MIP can move to the next phase. MIPs have a Frozen Period of 1 month. MIPs must not have had any changes for the last 1 month before they move to the next phase. 4. Fulfilled Feedback Period Requirements: This status is given once the MIP has fulfilled the defined Feedback Period and Frozen Period. After the MIP has waited out its Feedback Period and Frozen Period, it\u2019s ready for Formal Submission. Note that the Feedback Period and Frozen Period can overlap. 5. Formal Submission (FS) - This phase is when MIP Authors submit their complete MIP(s) to the Governance cycle by posting it to the formal submission forum category within the formal submission window of a governance cycle. - A MIP can be re-submitted to the formal submission process a maximum of 2 additional times (3 total), without having to go through phase 1- 4 again, if it failed to pass due to legitimate external reasons (e.g. got bundled in a governance poll or executive vote with a controversial proposal - subject to the governance facilitators judgement). 6. Approved by the Governance Facilitator(s) : This phase is when the MIP must be formally approved by the Governance Facilitators. Once approved by the Governance Facilitator, the MIP will be included in the inclusion poll of the Governance cycle. If the MIP is not approved by the Governance Facilitator, it may be reconsidered at a later date to enter the Governance cycle. 7. Governance Cycle : This phase is when MKR holders vote on whether to include the MIP in the governance poll, ultimately determining whether or not the MIP can formally enter the governance cycle. - Once approved for the governance poll, MKR holders determine whether to accept or reject the package of proposals in the governance poll and finally to ratify the result in the executive vote. 8. Executive Vote: This phase is when the MIP becomes officially ratified or not. Determined by MKR holders, the executive vote ultimately accepts or rejects the MIP. 9. Accepted/Rejected: The Executive vote results in either acceptance or rejection of the MIP. If passed, the MIP is officially accepted and is given the accepted status. If the executive vote fails to pass before expiring, the MIP is rejected. - As described in phase 5, a rejected MIP, can be resubmitted, and in some cases (if it was rejected for provable extraneous explanation) may be allowed to enter the next Governance cycle immediately. Other MIP Statuses: Withdrawn : when a MIP Author withdraws their MIP proposal, such as when: A MIP may be withdrawn at any point before it enters the Governance cycle. Note that a withdrawn proposal can be taken over from the original Author with a simple transition facilitated by a MIP Editor(s) and the respective parties. If the original MIP Author ceases to be available, the MIP Editor(s) may proceed with the transfer of Authors. Deferred : when a proposal has been deemed as not ready or not a priority but can be re-proposed at a later date. - Request for Comments (RFC) - Forum poll/signal request rejects a MIP Proposal. Obsolete : when a proposal is no longer used or is out of date, such as: A MIP is replaced with a new proposal. A MIP has been deferred for over 6 months. A MIP Author has abandoned the proposal and no person has communicated willingness to take over MIP Author responsibility. A MIP has been replaced by a newer, more updated MIP Proposal. A MIP no longer makes sense to keep in consideration. MIP Status Change Process: A status change for a MIP is requested by the MIP Author and will be reviewed by the MIP Editor(s) to see if it meets the status criteria of the requested status change. If it does, the Editor(s) will change the status of the MIP and the Author may proceed with the next stage of the process. If it does not, the MIP Editor(s) will revert with highlighted issues, and the Author must fix the highlighted issues before requesting another status change.","title":"MIP0c3: The MIP Lifecycle"},{"location":"core-governance/mip0/#mip0c4-mip-components-and-mip-component-types","text":"","title":"MIP0c4: MIP Components and MIP Component Types"},{"location":"core-governance/mip0/#mip-components","text":"When necessary, MIPs can have multiple components if it needs to contain multiple units of logic to satisfy completeness.

A problem space is defined as a list of issues that must be addressed in order for the Maker Protocol to be able to sustain itself and grow into the future Maker governance. Motivation The goal of having a defined governance paradigm is to give the community a complete overview of what specific MIPs are used to address specific problems. By having a Governance Paradigm in place, the community can reform and upgrade specific parts of the governance process while complexity and dependency issues are kept in check. At the same time, it also makes it more clear how the community can completely replace and overhaul the governance process, and create something new, while guaranteeing that all the problems that were solved by the old process are also fully solved by the new process. It is important at all times to have the best possible estimate of what the long-term problem space list will look like. The current list defined within this MIP represents the problems that the Maker Foundation currently believes need to be addressed in order to enable MakerDAO to become self-sustainable. The expectation is that this list will be changed over time as practical experience of the community is gained. After the ratification of this MIP, the Maker community can use the subproposal process to change the list at any time. Therefore, the problem space list is not permanent. The problem space list serves as a best estimate for the problems the Maker community must solve for over the course of the next few years and is expected to change as more information become available. Specification / Proposal Details MIP1 Components MIP1c1: Definitions MIP1c2: The Initial Problem Space MIP1c3: Changing the Problem Space MIP1c1: Definitions Problem Space A problem space is the representation of a particular problem or field of problems that must be addressed in order for the Maker Protocol to be able to sustain itself. Examples of problem spaces would be the process of onboarding new collateral types or the Maker governance decision process. Both of these complex problems require their own guidelines and produce their own set of learning experiences. Note that Problem Spaces do not define any persons or groups working in them, they are theoretical and largely static entities. Problem Spaces exist even if no one is working in that space. The Governance Paradigm Problem Space A complete list of known major issues, challenges, and opportunities that the Maker Community believes Maker Governance must be able to skillfully address and manage in order to continue to function and grow. The Governance Paradigm A complete set of processes, implemented through MIPs, that allows Maker Governance to address all of the items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. MIP Sets A MIP Set is a group of several MIPs that are interdependent, in which without the entire set of MIPs existing, one or more MIPs in the Set becomes inconsistent, invalid or nonsensical. The intention is for MIP sets to together describe a single complex behaviour in such a way that allows each individual MIP to be written following the principle of Specificity but work together as a cohesive modular whole. Amending the Governance Paradigm A Governance Paradigm can be amended by replacing specific MIPs, or an entire MIP Set, in the Governance Paradigm while maintaining correct interfacing with all other MIPs within the MIP set and wider Governance Paradigm. Replacing a Governance Paradigm A governance paradigm can be replaced in its entirety by replacing all MIPs in the Governance Paradigm with a complete grouping of new MIPs, contained in MIP Sets that fully address all items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space An individual MIP or MIP Set in the active Governance Paradigm cannot be replaced if the replacement doesn't properly interact with the other MIPs in the Governance Paradigm that the replaced MIP is dependent on, or that are dependent on the replaced MIP. Otherwise, the Governance Paradigm as a whole could break and MIPs could stop functioning correctly due to interdependency issues. Thus, you have to either replace an individual MIP or MIP Set in a Governance Paradigm or replace the entire Governance Paradigm with a completely new grouping of MIP Sets that fully address all items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. Amending the Problem Space If Maker Governance wishes to change the Governance Paradigm and processes more drastically, they need to alter the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. In most cases, this is done by expanding the Problem Space after practical experience makes it clear there are additional problems, challenges or opportunities that Maker Governance needs a clear predetermined process to deal with. However, it could also be reducing the scope of the Problem Space, or changing the language or logical grouping of some of its aspects. MIP1c2: The Initial Problem Space Problem Space List The current Governance Paradigm Problem Space is defined as follows and is organized in loose order of priority from a risk and complexity perspective: Core Governance Framework: Key governance structures laying the backbone of long-term governance, such as processes detailing how to organize executive votes and other critical processes. This is an important aspect of long-run governance and we need to put a formal structure in place in order to provide a path for all future problems to be addressed efficiently. Collateral Onboarding : A standardized process for adding collateral types to the Maker Protocol as well as a defined process for continuous management. Adding collateral to the Protocol is important for the diversification of the collateral portfolio, which is fundamental to the stability of Dai. Since Collateral onboarding is a core component of the Protocol, the Maker community requires a structured process for it to go smoothly and efficiently. Decentralized Oracle Freeze Module: Enable MKR holders to easily freeze the oracles in case of an oracle attack. Appeals Process: Enable MKR holders who abuse the Decentralized Oracle Freeze Module or other MKR-deposit based systems to be punished, as well as to appeal that punishment to MKR governance. An appeals process is important for both decentralized security modules and voter incentivization. Dai Stabilization Cycle: Manages Dai stability and other weekly adjustments. The stabilization cycle is necessary for the long-term formalization of the already existing process in order to improve transparency and accessibility. Vote Delegation: Enable vote delegation and manage the surrounding social processes. Vote delegation is crucial for long-run governance as it empowers all MKR holders to have a say by pooling their MKR to vote. Overall, vote delegation helps promote voting outcomes that more accurately represent the broader community's public discussion. Synthetic Assets: Onboard new synthetic assets and manage them on an ongoing basis. The onboarding of assets is a core component of the Protocol, thus the Maker community will require a structured process for it to go smoothly. Adding new synthetic asset types to the Maker also makes crypto assets more available to people across the globe. Oracles: As more collateral assets get onboarded to the Maker Protocol there needs to be a focus on how to scale oracles while maintaining their security. Formalizing the oracle requirements and structuring a formal process for onboarding and offboarding them is crucial to that. Emergency Oracles: Ensure emergency shutdown and oracle freeze will happen on time. Emergency oracles are crucial for keeping prices stable during the event of an emergency shutdown of the Maker Protocol. Creating a formal process for emergency oracles also ultimately helps protect both Dai and Vault owners. Dai Stability Adjustment Module: Automate Dai stability management. In the long-run, Maker governance cannot maintain the current manual process of running executive votes to constantly compute stability management, especially as more assets get onboarded to the Protocol. The DS Adjustment module will enable the continuation of stability management without the need to run executive votes. Website and Social Media: Operate makerdao.com and all official social media accounts. Communications and marketing are crucial for the brand of Maker and it is important that MKR holders have a say on how the DAO is publicly represented. The social accounts for Maker are currently maintained and run by the Maker Foundation. As we move closer towards the dissolution of the Foundation, these accounts and communication channels will need to be managed by the community and will require a formalized process in order to do so. Guardian Entities and Reserves: Source and manage a diversified reserve infrastructure. Having off-chain reserves improves the resilience of Dai during market crashes, and Guardians and reserves should decrease the risk of MKR dilution. Vote Incentives: Incentivize voting turnout and create a value-driven delegate ecosystem. Enabling incentive structures that increase voter engagement is beneficial to the broader Maker system because the bigger and more engaged the MKR voter base is, the less likely a governance attack can occur. Adding a formal voter incentive structure also allows the vote delegation mechanism to become self-sufficient in the long-run. Revisit Auction Design: A redesign of the auction mechanisms in the Maker Protocol. The current auctions system design was intended to be a short-term solution, so a redesign of the auctions could increase the efficiency of the system and reduce the probability of unexpected outcomes. Dai Foundation: Manage and fund the entity that controls legal and centralized assets, such as trademarks and copyrights, that are critical to MakerDAO. This is important for the safeguarding of the assets and preventing any possible misuse. It is critical that the community is able to have a formalized process for funding and interacting with the Dai Foundation. Important Note : - The problem spaces listed above are not final but rather estimates of the problems the Maker Foundation believes will need to be addressed over the course of the next few years on our path to self-sustainability. Overall, this is a starting point and does not represent a long term commitment. It is expected that it will change over time based on the needs and experience of the Maker community.

The current list defined within this MIP represents the problems that the Maker Foundation currently believes need to be addressed in order to enable MakerDAO to become self-sustainable. The expectation is that this list will be changed over time as practical experience of the community is gained. After the ratification of this MIP, the Maker community can use the subproposal process to change the list at any time. Therefore, the problem space list is not permanent.

Examples of problem spaces would be the process of onboarding new collateral types or the Maker governance decision process. Both of these complex problems require their own guidelines and produce their own set of learning experiences. Note that Problem Spaces do not define any persons or groups working in them, they are theoretical and largely static entities. Problem Spaces exist even if no one is working in that space. The Governance Paradigm Problem Space A complete list of known major issues, challenges, and opportunities that the Maker Community believes Maker Governance must be able to skillfully address and manage in order to continue to function and grow. The Governance Paradigm A complete set of processes, implemented through MIPs, that allows Maker Governance to address all of the items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. MIP Sets A MIP Set is a group of several MIPs that are interdependent, in which without the entire set of MIPs existing, one or more MIPs in the Set becomes inconsistent, invalid or nonsensical. The intention is for MIP sets to together describe a single complex behaviour in such a way that allows each individual MIP to be written following the principle of Specificity but work together as a cohesive modular whole. Amending the Governance Paradigm A Governance Paradigm can be amended by replacing specific MIPs, or an entire MIP Set, in the Governance Paradigm while maintaining correct interfacing with all other MIPs within the MIP set and wider Governance Paradigm. Replacing a Governance Paradigm A governance paradigm can be replaced in its entirety by replacing all MIPs in the Governance Paradigm with a complete grouping of new MIPs, contained in MIP Sets that fully address all items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space An individual MIP or MIP Set in the active Governance Paradigm cannot be replaced if the replacement doesn't properly interact with the other MIPs in the Governance Paradigm that the replaced MIP is dependent on, or that are dependent on the replaced MIP. Otherwise, the Governance Paradigm as a whole could break and MIPs could stop functioning correctly due to interdependency issues. Thus, you have to either replace an individual MIP or MIP Set in a Governance Paradigm or replace the entire Governance Paradigm with a completely new grouping of MIP Sets that fully address all items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. Amending the Problem Space If Maker Governance wishes to change the Governance Paradigm and processes more drastically, they need to alter the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. In most cases, this is done by expanding the Problem Space after practical experience makes it clear there are additional problems, challenges or opportunities that Maker Governance needs a clear predetermined process to deal with.

More specifically, it defines two phases: 1. Phase 1: when a core governance framework is put in place and a functional collateral onboarding process is ratified. 2. Phase 2: when the Problem Space is in the process of being addressed with MIPs and MIP Sets. Lastly, the proposal states that MIP2 itself will become obsolete when the Problem Space has officially been addressed. Motivation One of the critical motivations of the MIP framework is that there are a finite number of critical issues that must be covered with appropriate governance processes for the Maker system to be safe (see MIP1 Governance Paradigms). At the same time, the goal is also to ensure that the process of implementing and altering critical governance process logic is done at a pace that gives the community enough time to scrutinize and understand specific ideas. However, these two goals contradict each other in the initial \"launch period\" where there isn't a formal governance framework in place yet. As a result, the need to \"cover all bases\" by having a robust, simple solution for governance processes in place for all critical risks takes precedent over the goal of slowing down and deeply scrutinizing all proposals. Without proactive solutions in place, the community could be forced into undesirable reactive decision making in the event a critical problem or an opportunity occurs that doesn't yet have a defined process. Reactive decision making has the potential of bad precedents that weren\u2019t fully understood at the time. As a result, the community should prioritize getting the initial processes in place that will cover all the critical risks and opportunities that are built as a formalization of existing processes or knowledge in the community and Maker Foundation. Once the initial governance paradigm is in place the community can amend or replace it as necessary to build a more permanent and robust paradigm, taking advantage of the practical knowledge gained in the interim period.

The Governance Cycle provides a predictable framework for Maker Governance decisions. Furthermore, it provides participants (MKR holders) with a monthly overview of the decisions that are to be made, allowing participation despite time constraints. Motivation The goal of the standardized monthly governance cycle is to provide advance notification and high predictability of governance activities in order to enable MKR holders to stay informed on relevant topics and participate in voting despite being time-constrained. The structure of the governance cycle enables active governance participants to join the discussion at the proposal submission level from the beginning of the month, while less active governance participants can simply review the end results at the end of the month and decide whether or not to vote for the final executive vote. Specification / Proposal Details MIP3 Components MIP3c1: Governance Cycle Breakdown MIP3c2: Default Inclusion Threshold Modification Subproposals MIP3c1: Governance Cycle Breakdown Each monthly governance cycle begins on the first Monday of the month, with Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) submitted by community members (defined within the MIP0 Framework). These proposals will be considered for inclusion at the end of the month's Executive vote. The governance cycle ends with an Executive vote that begins on the 4 th Monday of the month. Proposals submitted must follow the guidelines defined in MIP0. Week-by-week breakdown of the Monthly Governance Cycle Time is inclusive and in based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and the Gregorian calendar Week 1 - 1 st Monday-Wednesday of the month: - The Formal submission (Phase 5 described in MIP0c2) of proposals that are to be included in the new governance cycle. - The formal submission is done on the formal submission category on the MIPs Discourse forum (as defined in Phase 5 in MIP0c2) - 1 st Thursday of the month: - Inclusion Poll Review (Governance Meeting): Discussion surrounding which proposals are in accordance with guidelines (defined in the MIP0 Framework), which proposals are inadequate (even if technically following the guidelines) Week 2 2 nd Monday of the month : The Governance facilitators publish an inclusion poll. The proposals that the specific Governance Facilitators' have general consensus on are included, but each Governance Facilitator, in their own can add their own individual short description and list order (which is critical for voter heuristic behaviour and important power of a governance facilitator in times of dispute or uncertainty). The Default Inclusion Threshold is a variable amount that can be changed by MIP3c3 sub proposals. The default inclusion threshold value is automatically counted towards the no vote tally of each item in the inclusion poll. The default inclusion threshold is changed with MIP3c2 subproposals. An MKR voter has 2 options for each proposal in an inclusion poll: Yes or no. Where the no votes simply increase the barrier of the proposal to pass. Outcomes: If the Yes votes for a given option in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of No votes and the default inclusion threshold , the proposal will be included in the governance poll. If votes: yes ( no + default inclusion threshold ) = inclusion in governance poll. 2 nd Thursday of the month: The Governance Poll Review (Governance Meeting) : occurs, covering the general risk and governance topics at hand and without any MIP decision making discussion. Week 3 3 rd Monday-Wednesday of the month: The Governance poll submitted by the Governance Facilitator. The Governance poll will run from Monday until Wednesday. The Governance Poll is a yes/no MKR poll that accepts or rejects the combination of all MIPs that passed the inclusion poll stage, including any executive vote code from Technical MIP components or sub proposals. 3 rd Thursday of the month: Executive Vote Review (Governance Meeting) - this public meeting will focus on either future proposals or controversy around the current governance poll and the future upcoming executive vote. In case there are too many no votes in the governance poll, and there is evidence that there is an effort to silence legitimate concerns in the community this meeting provides opportunities for compromise and the community and governance facilitators must consider whether it is creating a risk of governance split. If a governance facilitator believes that the proposed executive vote will result in a governance split, the Governance Facilitator should not deploy the executive vote and must instead work with the community to resolve the problem. Thus, if all governance facilitators are in consensus that the executive vote creates a significant risk of a community split, the executive vote will not happen and the MIPs that were supposed to be up for an executive vote, instead have their status changed to deferred. Week 4 4 th Monday of the month: The Executive vote is submitted if the governance poll has passed and the no votes are not too high to deem it a threat to consensus. Regular Executive votes must have an expiration of 7 days, meaning they blank themselves after 7 days. MIPs and Sub Proposals only get the accepted status if the executive vote they are included in passes within the 7-day limit. If the executive vote fails to pass within the 7-day limit, the MIPs and Sub Proposals have their status changed to rejected. 4 th Thursday of the month: The Retro Planning Meeting occurs, covering the general risk and governance topics at hand and without any MIP decision making discussion. Discussion around the governance poll outcomes (for proposed collateral types) and proposals for next month, or retrospective on current governance cycle controversy. MIP3 sub proposals focus on modifying the default inclusion threshold for the inclusion polls. They are submitted to the governance cycle like any other proposal and their modified default inclusion threshold takes effect from the governance cycle following the successful passing of their governance cycle\u2019s executive vote.

If votes: yes ( no + default inclusion threshold ) = inclusion in governance poll. 2 nd Thursday of the month: The Governance Poll Review (Governance Meeting) : occurs, covering the general risk and governance topics at hand and without any MIP decision making discussion. Week 3 3 rd Monday-Wednesday of the month: The Governance poll submitted by the Governance Facilitator. The Governance poll will run from Monday until Wednesday. The Governance Poll is a yes/no MKR poll that accepts or rejects the combination of all MIPs that passed the inclusion poll stage, including any executive vote code from Technical MIP components or sub proposals. 3 rd Thursday of the month: Executive Vote Review (Governance Meeting) - this public meeting will focus on either future proposals or controversy around the current governance poll and the future upcoming executive vote. In case there are too many no votes in the governance poll, and there is evidence that there is an effort to silence legitimate concerns in the community this meeting provides opportunities for compromise and the community and governance facilitators must consider whether it is creating a risk of governance split. If a governance facilitator believes that the proposed executive vote will result in a governance split, the Governance Facilitator should not deploy the executive vote and must instead work with the community to resolve the problem. Thus, if all governance facilitators are in consensus that the executive vote creates a significant risk of a community split, the executive vote will not happen and the MIPs that were supposed to be up for an executive vote, instead have their status changed to deferred. Week 4 4 th Monday of the month: The Executive vote is submitted if the governance poll has passed and the no votes are not too high to deem it a threat to consensus. Regular Executive votes must have an expiration of 7 days, meaning they blank themselves after 7 days. MIPs and Sub Proposals only get the accepted status if the executive vote they are included in passes within the 7-day limit. If the executive vote fails to pass within the 7-day limit, the MIPs and Sub Proposals have their status changed to rejected. 4 th Thursday of the month: The Retro Planning Meeting occurs, covering the general risk and governance topics at hand and without any MIP decision making discussion. Discussion around the governance poll outcomes (for proposed collateral types) and proposals for next month, or retrospective on current governance cycle controversy. MIP3 sub proposals focus on modifying the default inclusion threshold for the inclusion polls. They are submitted to the governance cycle like any other proposal and their modified default inclusion threshold takes effect from the governance cycle following the successful passing of their governance cycle\u2019s executive vote.","title":"Week-by-week breakdown of the Monthly Governance Cycle"},{"location":"core-governance/mip3/#governance-cycle-overview-diagram","text":"","title":"Governance Cycle Overview Diagram"},{"location":"core-governance/mip3/#mip-life-cycle-overview","text":"","title":"MIP Life Cycle Overview"},{"location":"core-governance/mip3/#mip3c2-default-inclusion-threshold-modification-subproposals","text":"The Default Inclusion Threshold can be modified with subproposals.

Emergency votes are executive votes that can be initiated by any community member. Motivation This standard is being proposed in order to allow the community to overcome the constraints of the governance cycle (MIP3) in special situations where it is time critical to make changes or remove a part of the operating system. Specification / Proposal Details MIP5 Components MIP5c1: Governance Facilitator Emergency Votes MIP5c2: An Emergency State Change MIP5c1: Governance Facilitator Emergency Votes A governance facilitator emergency vote encodes one or more website URLs into an on-chain voting contract (spell), as well as containing logic that stops any payment stream to the existing governance facilitators. If the executive vote gets the most MKR votes and becomes the active proposal the existing Governance facilitators are then removed. The list of website URLs then corresponds to a list of one or more new Interim Governance facilitators and their governance platforms that will replace the current governance facilitators. The current governance cycle is canceled, and the new Interim Governance Facilitators initiate a new governance cycle on the following 1 st Monday of the month. MIP5c2: An Emergency State Change An emergency executive vote that contains state change logic. For example, changing the DSR or removing a collateral type. These types of votes can in some cases be used to reduce risk in the system, help stabilize the peg, or fix critical technical issues. However, they are also very dangerous and must be used carefully as they can potentially be attacks that, for example, drain all the collateral from the system. Governance Facilitators can ignore an emergency state change, or either declare support for an emergency state change by adding it as an irregularly scheduled executive vote on their governance portals, or declare it a governance attack, potentially encouraging users to trigger an emergency shutdown in response.","title":"Emergency Voting System"},{"location":"core-governance/mip5/#mip5-emergency-voting-system","text":"","title":"MIP5: Emergency Voting System"},{"location":"core-governance/mip5/#preamble","text":"MIP#: 5 Title: Emergency Voting System Author(s): Rune Christensen (@Rune23) and Charles St.Louis (@CPSTL) Type: Process Status: Assigned by MIP Editor Date Proposed: 2020-04-06 Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"core-governance/mip5/#summary","text":"This proposal defines an emergency voting system.
