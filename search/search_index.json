Motivation MakerDAO is evolving into an organization that is trustless, fully decentralized, open-sourced, and self-sustainable. In order to further enable this gradual evolution while maintaining governance functionality both during this process and after the dissolution of the Maker Foundation, Maker will be governed using Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs). The purpose of the MIPs Framework is to open up the ability to improve Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol to anyone in the community. By empowering the participation of the community and other stakeholders to have a standard approach to proposing improvements, specifications, or process and state changes, the goal is to enable organic growth that will in turn bring MakerDAO closer to self-sustainability. In order for MIPs to be functional they need to comply with a basic standard outlining their internal structure and external dependencies. This standard is MIPs described in MIP0, the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework. Specification / Proposal Details MIP0c1: Definitions of the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs): are the preferred mechanism for improving Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol. Through an open and documented process, the goal is to collect as much community feedback as possible and reach the broadest possible consensus on how the Maker Protocol should evolve. A proposal clearly defines how and why Maker Governance or the Maker Protocol should be changed and ensures that this improvement is introduced in a responsible way, respecting the highest quality, security and community standards. MIP0: The genesis MIP defining the MIPs framework. This MIP defines all of the processes that are required for the implementation of future MIPs. MIP Sets: A MIP set is a group of several MIPs that are interdependent, in which without the entire set of MIPs existing, one or more MIPs in the Set become inconsistent, invalid or nonsensical. The intention is for MIP sets to together describe a single complex behaviour in such a way that allows each individual MIP to be written following the principle of Specificity but work together as a cohesive modular whole. MIP Types: MIPs are separated into a number of types, and each type has its own list of MIPs and processes. Process MIP: Process MIPs are used to create and define a specific recurring process that the Maker Protocol or Governance will employ. Subproposals (SPs): A subproposal is an instance of a sub-process that has been defined by a specific MIP. Subproposals are named in the following format: MIP0-SP1 (where MIP0 is a Process MIP and MIP0-SP1 is a subproposal under that Process MIP) Minimum Feedback Period: The minimum amount of time within which the community is able to give feedback in response to a proposed MIP. Minimum Frozen Period: The minimum amount of time during which a MIP must remain unchanged (frozen) before it can be submitted for ratification/implementation. Governance Facilitator(s): Governance Facilitators are tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities, anything from general administration to signals gathering to governance scheduling. MIP Editor(s): Enforce the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and program. The expectation is that the program will start out with an interim editor from the Maker Foundation and that others will join later. Domain Teams : Domain Teams work for the DAO, are onboarded through governance and are paid by the Protocol. Domain teams perform defined duties for the DAO, such as overseeing critical processes and mitigating risk. These teams consist of but are not limited to Risk, Oracles, Smart Contracts or Legal. MIP0c2: Core Principles Specificity: A MIP needs to define and address a specific behaviour or single responsibility. MIPs with many different behaviours or responsibilities will not be allowed and must be split up into multiple MIPs. This mitigates the risk of having \u201cfine print\u201d or potential attacks hidden in large, complex MIPs. Completeness: A MIP or MIP Set is complete if it has all the necessary or appropriate parts that cover a whole behaviour and avoids being only a specific part of a greater whole. This is important for both understandability, readability and accessibility of MIPs. Avoid overlap: Multiple MIPs should not implement the same type of behaviour independently. For instance, there should not be two separate but interchangeable ways to do collateral onboarding. This way the primary and best-understood process for each particular behaviour will be fairly available to everyone, without risking having a knowledge gap that makes it possible for some actors with better access to information to use different and potentially better processes Clarity: A MIP must not have equally valid conflicting interpretations. MIP Authors and MIP Editors must strive to reduce ambiguity. A MIP must be as clear and easy to understand as possible. Any ambiguous MIPs are likely to cause contention or confusion in the future. Making everything as clear as possible also aids readability and helps to mitigate the risk of hidden attacks. Brevity: A MIP must be as short as possible, including only that which is essential given the other core principles. The shorter MIPs are the more likely participants in governance are to read them in full. This also serves to reduce the surface area for hidden attacks. MIP0c3: The MIP Lifecycle The MIP Lifecycle Flow and MIP Statuses MIP Status Criteria 1. Conception: The lifecycle of a MIP begins when the MIP proposal is posted on the Maker forum. However, in order for a MIP to move to the next stage, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria (1) described below: Submitted to the MIPs Discourse Forum. Submitted to the MIPs Github repository (with a Pull Request created by the MIP Author or MIP Editor). The format must follow the appropriate MIP Template for its type. MIPs must be original or replacement versions of older MIPs (No repeats allowed). 2. Approved by MIP Editor(s): This phase of a MIP\u2019s life cycle is when the MIP Editor(s) confirms that the proposed MIP follows the correct structure and editorial criteria defined in the MIP template. If the criteria is not met, the MIP Editor(s) will provide an explanation to the MIP Author as to why and allow them to make the appropriate changes before reconsideration. If the criteria have been met, the MIP Editor(s) performs the following actions: The MIP is approved by a MIP Editor(s) and is assigned a formal MIP number. The PR is merged in by a MIP Editor(s). 3. Request for Comments (RFC): This phase is when a MIP goes through a formal review period, including feedback from the community, further drafting and additions. The timeline for the RFC phase is defined by its Feedback Period and Frozen Period. In order to move to the next phase, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria listed below: MIP Author finalizes changes of the MIP, based on community feedback. MIPs have a Feedback Period of 3 months. The RFC phase lasts at least 3 months before the MIP can move to the next phase. MIPs have a Frozen Period of 1 month. MIPs must not have had any changes for the last 1 month before they move to the next phase. 4. Fulfilled Feedback Period Requirements: This status is given once the MIP has fulfilled the defined Feedback Period and Frozen Period. After the MIP has waited out its Feedback Period and Frozen Period, it\u2019s ready for Formal Submission. Note that the Feedback Period and Frozen Period can overlap. 5. Formal Submission (FS): This phase is when MIP Authors submit their complete MIP(s) to the Governance cycle by posting it to the formal submission forum category within the formal submission window of a governance cycle. - A MIP can be re-submitted to the formal submission process a maximum of 2 additional times (3 total), without having to go through phase 1- 4 again, if it failed to pass due to legitimate external reasons (e.g. got bundled in a governance poll or executive vote with a controversial proposal - subject to the governance facilitators judgement). 6. Approved by the Governance Facilitator(s): This phase is when the MIP must be formally approved by the Governance Facilitators. Once approved by the Governance Facilitator, the MIP will be included in the inclusion poll of the Governance cycle. If the MIP is not approved by the Governance Facilitator, it may be reconsidered at a later date to enter the Governance cycle. 7. Governance Cycle: This phase is when MKR holders vote on whether to include the MIP in the governance poll, ultimately determining whether or not the MIP can formally enter the governance cycle. - Once approved for the governance poll, MKR holders determine whether to accept or reject the package of proposals in the governance poll and finally to ratify the result in the executive vote. 8. Executive Vote: This phase is when the MIP becomes officially ratified or not. Determined by MKR holders, the executive vote ultimately accepts or rejects the MIP. 9. Accepted/Rejected: The Executive vote results in either acceptance or rejection of the MIP. If passed, the MIP is officially accepted and is given the accepted status. If the executive vote fails to pass before expiring, the MIP is rejected. - As described in phase 5, a rejected MIP, can be resubmitted, and in some cases (if it was rejected for provable extraneous explanation) may be allowed to enter the next Governance cycle immediately. Other MIP Statuses: Withdrawn: when a MIP Author withdraws their MIP proposal, such as when: A MIP may be withdrawn at any point before it enters the Governance cycle. Note that a withdrawn proposal can be taken over from the original Author with a simple transition facilitated by a MIP Editor(s) and the respective parties. If the original MIP Author ceases to be available, the MIP Editor(s) may proceed with the transfer of Authors. Deferred: when a proposal has been deemed as not ready or not a priority but can be re-proposed at a later date. - Request for Comments (RFC) - Forum poll/signal request rejects a MIP Proposal. Obsolete: when a proposal is no longer used or is out of date, such as: A MIP is replaced with a new proposal. A MIP has been deferred for over 6 months. A MIP Author has abandoned the proposal and no person has communicated willingness to take over MIP Author responsibility. A MIP has been replaced by a newer, more updated MIP Proposal. A MIP no longer makes sense to keep in consideration. MIP Status Change Process: A status change for a MIP is requested by the MIP Author and will be reviewed by the MIP Editor(s) to see if it meets the status criteria of the requested status change. If it does, the Editor(s) will change the status of the MIP and the Author may proceed with the next stage of the process. If it does not, the MIP Editor(s) will revert with highlighted issues, and the Author must fix the highlighted issues before requesting another status change. MIP0c4: MIP Components and MIP Component Types MIP Components When necessary, MIPs can have multiple components if it needs to contain multiple units of logic to satisfy completeness. A MIP can also have only a single component. MIP components are categorized by types, depending on what kind of logic they contain. MIP components are named by their parent MIP. The abbreviation convention MIPXcY is used to refer to these components (as seen in this document). A MIP component has one type or no types. Component Types Process MIP Component Summary: The purpose of a Process MIP component is to shape a specific process flow for the Maker community to adopt and standardize with respect to how governance operates. This MIP component type helps streamline specific processes in a transparent, open and traceable manner. A Process MIP will provide a publicly documented scope of a proposed process framework as well as a detailed description of the subproposal structure. Special Template: N/A Important Notes: A Process MIP component must define the Feedback Period and Frozen Period for its sub proposals. Sub proposals of Process MIP components with additional MIP Component types inherit the same types. Subproposals Summary: A subproposal is an expedited process that is defined within a MIP to serve as a definition of how to run a given process within the MIPs framework. Subproposals require a template, a feedback period and a frozen period and are submitted using that template. Subproposals go through the MIPs process in the same way that full MIPs do. The template, feedback period and frozen period for a set of subproposals are defined using a MIP component known as a Process component. Any MIP containing a Process Component gains the Process type. The subproposal naming convention is MIPXcY-SPZ where Y is the Process Component that contains the subproposal template and X is the MIP containing that component. This is important in order to delineate between different types of subproposal defined in the same MIP under different Process components. Special Template: N/A MIP0c5: MIP Replacement Process A MIP can define one or more replacement targets in its preamble. If the MIP is given the accepted status, the replacement target(s) MIPs then receive the Obsolete status and effectively become inactive. The replaced MIP will in its MIP document contain the number of the MIP that replaced it, and other MIPs that depend on the replaced MIP, will instead interact with the new MIP. Due to the fact that the dependencies carry over, a MIP with defined replacement targets must, in order to be valid, strictly adhere to dependency requirements and interface correctly with MIPs that depend on the replaced MIP, and thus after the replacement with the new MIP. MIP0c6: Supporting Materials MIPs can optionally refer to external materials. External materials must be added to the MIPs github in the same folder as the MIP which references them. Externally referenced materials are not MIP content, and are not ratified when a MIP becomes Accepted unless it is explicitly stated otherwise in a MIP Component specification. MIP0c7: MIP Templates General MIP Template - The General MIP Template should be used for MIPs whenever a more specific ratified template is not more appropriate. - The General MIP Template is located at General-MIP-Template.md . This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status. Technical MIP Template - The Technical MIP Template should be used for MIPs whenever a MIP proposes changes to the smart contract code within the Maker Protocol. - The Technical MIP Template is located at Technical-MIP-Template.md . This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status. MIP0c8: MIP0 Domain Role Dependencies The MIPs Framework depends on these types of Domain Roles: - MIP Editor(s): Enforces the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and program. The expectation is that the program will start out with an interim editor from the Maker Foundation and that others will join later. - Specific authority of the MIP Editor(s) in MIP0 processes: - The MIP Editor(s) controls phase 2 of the MIP lifecycle and can assign MIP numbers - The MIP Editor(s) is an admin on the MIPs Github repository - The MIP Editor(s) is a moderator on the MIPs Discourse forum - The MIP Editor(s) is responsible for updating the status of MIPs, as described in MIP0c4 \u201cThe MIP Lifecycle\u201d. - Governance Facilitator: Operates voting frontends, runs governance meetings and accepts MIPs that are ready to be included in the Governance Cycle and thus, voted on. - Specific authority of the Governance Facilitator in MIP0 processes: - Consensus from all governance facilitators controls phase 6 of the MIP lifecycle, which allows them to, with consensus, add valid MIPs to the inclusion poll of the next governance cycle, moving them from phase 5 (formal submission) to phase 7 (governance cycle). Personnel may be added to these roles using a MIP0c10 sub-proposal. Personnel may be removed from these roles using a MIP0c11 sub-proposal. MIP0c9: Core Personnel Role List This list can be amended through the core personnel onboarding (MIP0c12) and offboarding components (MIP0c13) of MIP0. Entries into this list should follow the following template: - Person Name: The name of the person in the core role. - Sub-proposal Number (MIP0c12-SP): # - Core Role: The core role in which the person operates. - Date Added: date in (yyyy-mm-dd) format Active Core Personnel List: Governance Facilitators: Person Name: Richard Brown Sub-proposal Number (MIP0c12-SP): N/A (Governance Facilitator was ratified prior to the MIPs process. Reference: Mandate: Interim Governance Facilitators ) Core Role: Governance Facilitator Date Added: 2019-09-09 ( Poll: Ratify the Interim Governance Facilitator Mandate ) MIP Editors: Person Name: Charles St.Louis Sub-proposal Number (MIP0c12-SP): 1 Core Role: MIP Editor Date Added: 2020-05-02 ( Ratification Vote ) MIP0c10: MIP Editor Role Responsibilities The MIP Editor enforces the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and framework. This includes: - Maintain and manage mips.makerdao.com. - Provide feedback and have discussions in the MIP section of forum.makerdao.com (ex: helping vet proposal ideas). - MIPs processing. - Management and organization of MIP and Subproposal Preambles. - Onboard and vet new MIP Editors. - Enforcing the proper MIPs process with responsibilities such as: - Confirm that the title accurately describes the content of the proposal. - Confirm there is a (real) dedicated author, coordinator, funder and/or sponsor, etc. of the MIP. - Assign proposed MIP's formal number labels. - Change MIP statuses. - Correct MIP category placement. - Correspond with MIP authors/coordinators. - Review the MIP for obvious defects in the language (format, completeness, spelling, grammar, sentence structure) and that it follows the style guide (template). MIP Editors are allowed to correct problems themselves, but are not required to do so and can send comments to authors to improve it themselves. - Work and communicate with Governance Facilitators on coordinating governance and executive votes in relation to MIPs and the governance cycle. Selection Criteria The following criteria should be used when selecting a MIP Editor: A complete understanding of the MIPs Framework Knowledge share will occur when onboarded but the candidate must be very familiar with the framework and how other improvement proposal frameworks operate. Required to be a community member for some time. This can be shown through various proof of participation methods, such as: Past forum posts Attendance of community and governance calls Articles written about Maker or Dai Familiarity with the technical inner workings of the Maker Protocol (bonus) Experience with Github Merging, editing, closing Pull Requests Addressing issues Adding tags / labels Experience with the Markdown language MIPs will be written in Markdown, so editors will need to be familiar with the language. Addition Once a person has been onboarded to the MIP Editor role, they will be added to Github and subscribed to watching the MIP repository. They will also become a moderator in the MIPs Rocket.Chat Channel and the MIPs Forum. Much of the correspondence regarding MIPs will be handled through GitHub as well in the MakerDAO forums. Removal A MIP Editor should be considered for removal if they are: Not adequately performing their defined duties Absent from their duties for a prolonged period Displaying biased or malicious behaviour Expressing unwillingness to continue in their role. The removal process begins once the community has agreed on the reasoning for removal. This process must be communicated publicly via the forums in order to provide complete transparency. The MIP Editor will then be removed from the following channels: Github RocketChat Forums MIP0c11: Governance Facilitator Role Responsibilities The Governance Facilitator's responsibilities are defined as the following: Core Responsibilities - Responsible for ensuring the health and integrity of communication channels that are used for communication within MakerDAO. These tasks include moderation duties, establishing processes and social norms, and defending the channels from trolling and Sybil attacks. - Required to remain neutral and objective on issues outside the governance domain and focus on policy, procedure and facilitation. - Required to schedule, run and moderate weekly governance and risk meetings from a position of neutrality. - Required to manage and run governance processes as directed by relevant Accepted MIPs or MIP sets. - Required to create on-chain polls on the \u2018official\u2019 voting frontend as directed by governance processes defined in relevant Accepted MIPs or MIP sets. - Should aim to foster a culture of openness, receptiveness and reasoned discussion within the community. - Should work with the community to operate an emergency voting process to defend the system in the event of an emergency. - Should aim to onboard and maintain at least three Governance Facilitators at all times while prioritising candidates from unrepresented geographic regions. Encouraging Participation - Should work to maintain and encourage healthy debate, in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Scientific Governance and Risk Framework and the Core Foundation Principals. - Should ensure that the upcoming governance schedule is well communicated to all stakeholders at least a week in advance. - Should aim to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in the governance process. - Should ensure that new members of the community understand the general level of decorum and civility expected by the group, that they have the resources they need to get onboarded quickly. Improving Efficiency Should ensure that once debate reaches its natural end that appropriate consensus gathering methods take place.

In order to further enable this gradual evolution while maintaining governance functionality both during this process and after the dissolution of the Maker Foundation, Maker will be governed using Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs). The purpose of the MIPs Framework is to open up the ability to improve Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol to anyone in the community. By empowering the participation of the community and other stakeholders to have a standard approach to proposing improvements, specifications, or process and state changes, the goal is to enable organic growth that will in turn bring MakerDAO closer to self-sustainability. In order for MIPs to be functional they need to comply with a basic standard outlining their internal structure and external dependencies. This standard is MIPs described in MIP0, the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"MIP0/mip0/#specification-proposal-details","text":"","title":"Specification / Proposal Details"},{"location":"MIP0/mip0/#mip0c1-definitions-of-the-maker-improvement-proposal-framework","text":"Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs): are the preferred mechanism for improving Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol. Through an open and documented process, the goal is to collect as much community feedback as possible and reach the broadest possible consensus on how the Maker Protocol should evolve. A proposal clearly defines how and why Maker Governance or the Maker Protocol should be changed and ensures that this improvement is introduced in a responsible way, respecting the highest quality, security and community standards. MIP0: The genesis MIP defining the MIPs framework. This MIP defines all of the processes that are required for the implementation of future MIPs. MIP Sets: A MIP set is a group of several MIPs that are interdependent, in which without the entire set of MIPs existing, one or more MIPs in the Set become inconsistent, invalid or nonsensical. The intention is for MIP sets to together describe a single complex behaviour in such a way that allows each individual MIP to be written following the principle of Specificity but work together as a cohesive modular whole. MIP Types: MIPs are separated into a number of types, and each type has its own list of MIPs and processes. Process MIP: Process MIPs are used to create and define a specific recurring process that the Maker Protocol or Governance will employ. Subproposals (SPs): A subproposal is an instance of a sub-process that has been defined by a specific MIP. Subproposals are named in the following format: MIP0-SP1 (where MIP0 is a Process MIP and MIP0-SP1 is a subproposal under that Process MIP) Minimum Feedback Period: The minimum amount of time within which the community is able to give feedback in response to a proposed MIP. Minimum Frozen Period: The minimum amount of time during which a MIP must remain unchanged (frozen) before it can be submitted for ratification/implementation. Governance Facilitator(s): Governance Facilitators are tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities, anything from general administration to signals gathering to governance scheduling. MIP Editor(s): Enforce the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and program. The expectation is that the program will start out with an interim editor from the Maker Foundation and that others will join later. Domain Teams : Domain Teams work for the DAO, are onboarded through governance and are paid by the Protocol. Domain teams perform defined duties for the DAO, such as overseeing critical processes and mitigating risk. These teams consist of but are not limited to Risk, Oracles, Smart Contracts or Legal.","title":"MIP0c1: Definitions of the Maker Improvement Proposal Framework"},{"location":"MIP0/mip0/#mip0c2-core-principles","text":"Specificity: A MIP needs to define and address a specific behaviour or single responsibility. MIPs with many different behaviours or responsibilities will not be allowed and must be split up into multiple MIPs. This mitigates the risk of having \u201cfine print\u201d or potential attacks hidden in large, complex MIPs. Completeness: A MIP or MIP Set is complete if it has all the necessary or appropriate parts that cover a whole behaviour and avoids being only a specific part of a greater whole. This is important for both understandability, readability and accessibility of MIPs. Avoid overlap: Multiple MIPs should not implement the same type of behaviour independently. For instance, there should not be two separate but interchangeable ways to do collateral onboarding. This way the primary and best-understood process for each particular behaviour will be fairly available to everyone, without risking having a knowledge gap that makes it possible for some actors with better access to information to use different and potentially better processes Clarity: A MIP must not have equally valid conflicting interpretations. MIP Authors and MIP Editors must strive to reduce ambiguity. A MIP must be as clear and easy to understand as possible. Any ambiguous MIPs are likely to cause contention or confusion in the future. Making everything as clear as possible also aids readability and helps to mitigate the risk of hidden attacks. Brevity: A MIP must be as short as possible, including only that which is essential given the other core principles. The shorter MIPs are the more likely participants in governance are to read them in full. This also serves to reduce the surface area for hidden attacks.","title":"MIP0c2: Core Principles"},{"location":"MIP0/mip0/#mip0c3-the-mip-lifecycle","text":"The MIP Lifecycle Flow and MIP Statuses MIP Status Criteria 1. Conception: The lifecycle of a MIP begins when the MIP proposal is posted on the Maker forum. However, in order for a MIP to move to the next stage, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria (1) described below: Submitted to the MIPs Discourse Forum. Submitted to the MIPs Github repository (with a Pull Request created by the MIP Author or MIP Editor). The format must follow the appropriate MIP Template for its type. MIPs must be original or replacement versions of older MIPs (No repeats allowed). 2. Approved by MIP Editor(s): This phase of a MIP\u2019s life cycle is when the MIP Editor(s) confirms that the proposed MIP follows the correct structure and editorial criteria defined in the MIP template. If the criteria is not met, the MIP Editor(s) will provide an explanation to the MIP Author as to why and allow them to make the appropriate changes before reconsideration. If the criteria have been met, the MIP Editor(s) performs the following actions: The MIP is approved by a MIP Editor(s) and is assigned a formal MIP number. The PR is merged in by a MIP Editor(s). 3. Request for Comments (RFC): This phase is when a MIP goes through a formal review period, including feedback from the community, further drafting and additions. The timeline for the RFC phase is defined by its Feedback Period and Frozen Period. In order to move to the next phase, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria listed below: MIP Author finalizes changes of the MIP, based on community feedback. MIPs have a Feedback Period of 3 months. The RFC phase lasts at least 3 months before the MIP can move to the next phase. MIPs have a Frozen Period of 1 month. MIPs must not have had any changes for the last 1 month before they move to the next phase. 4. Fulfilled Feedback Period Requirements: This status is given once the MIP has fulfilled the defined Feedback Period and Frozen Period. After the MIP has waited out its Feedback Period and Frozen Period, it\u2019s ready for Formal Submission. Note that the Feedback Period and Frozen Period can overlap. 5. Formal Submission (FS): This phase is when MIP Authors submit their complete MIP(s) to the Governance cycle by posting it to the formal submission forum category within the formal submission window of a governance cycle. - A MIP can be re-submitted to the formal submission process a maximum of 2 additional times (3 total), without having to go through phase 1- 4 again, if it failed to pass due to legitimate external reasons (e.g. got bundled in a governance poll or executive vote with a controversial proposal - subject to the governance facilitators judgement). 6. Approved by the Governance Facilitator(s): This phase is when the MIP must be formally approved by the Governance Facilitators. Once approved by the Governance Facilitator, the MIP will be included in the inclusion poll of the Governance cycle. If the MIP is not approved by the Governance Facilitator, it may be reconsidered at a later date to enter the Governance cycle. 7. Governance Cycle: This phase is when MKR holders vote on whether to include the MIP in the governance poll, ultimately determining whether or not the MIP can formally enter the governance cycle. - Once approved for the governance poll, MKR holders determine whether to accept or reject the package of proposals in the governance poll and finally to ratify the result in the executive vote. 8. Executive Vote: This phase is when the MIP becomes officially ratified or not. Determined by MKR holders, the executive vote ultimately accepts or rejects the MIP. 9. Accepted/Rejected: The Executive vote results in either acceptance or rejection of the MIP. If passed, the MIP is officially accepted and is given the accepted status. If the executive vote fails to pass before expiring, the MIP is rejected. - As described in phase 5, a rejected MIP, can be resubmitted, and in some cases (if it was rejected for provable extraneous explanation) may be allowed to enter the next Governance cycle immediately. Other MIP Statuses: Withdrawn: when a MIP Author withdraws their MIP proposal, such as when: A MIP may be withdrawn at any point before it enters the Governance cycle. Note that a withdrawn proposal can be taken over from the original Author with a simple transition facilitated by a MIP Editor(s) and the respective parties. If the original MIP Author ceases to be available, the MIP Editor(s) may proceed with the transfer of Authors. Deferred: when a proposal has been deemed as not ready or not a priority but can be re-proposed at a later date. - Request for Comments (RFC) - Forum poll/signal request rejects a MIP Proposal. Obsolete: when a proposal is no longer used or is out of date, such as: A MIP is replaced with a new proposal. A MIP has been deferred for over 6 months. A MIP Author has abandoned the proposal and no person has communicated willingness to take over MIP Author responsibility. A MIP has been replaced by a newer, more updated MIP Proposal. A MIP no longer makes sense to keep in consideration. MIP Status Change Process: A status change for a MIP is requested by the MIP Author and will be reviewed by the MIP Editor(s) to see if it meets the status criteria of the requested status change. If it does, the Editor(s) will change the status of the MIP and the Author may proceed with the next stage of the process. If it does not, the MIP Editor(s) will revert with highlighted issues, and the Author must fix the highlighted issues before requesting another status change.","title":"MIP0c3: The MIP Lifecycle"},{"location":"MIP0/mip0/#mip0c4-mip-components-and-mip-component-types","text":"MIP Components When necessary, MIPs can have multiple components if it needs to contain multiple units of logic to satisfy completeness. A MIP can also have only a single component. MIP components are categorized by types, depending on what kind of logic they contain. MIP components are named by their parent MIP. The abbreviation convention MIPXcY is used to refer to these components (as seen in this document). A MIP component has one type or no types. Component Types Process MIP Component Summary: The purpose of a Process MIP component is to shape a specific process flow for the Maker community to adopt and standardize with respect to how governance operates. This MIP component type helps streamline specific processes in a transparent, open and traceable manner. A Process MIP will provide a publicly documented scope of a proposed process framework as well as a detailed description of the subproposal structure. Special Template: N/A Important Notes: A Process MIP component must define the Feedback Period and Frozen Period for its sub proposals. Sub proposals of Process MIP components with additional MIP Component types inherit the same types. Subproposals Summary: A subproposal is an expedited process that is defined within a MIP to serve as a definition of how to run a given process within the MIPs framework. Subproposals require a template, a feedback period and a frozen period and are submitted using that template. Subproposals go through the MIPs process in the same way that full MIPs do. The template, feedback period and frozen period for a set of subproposals are defined using a MIP component known as a Process component. Any MIP containing a Process Component gains the Process type. The subproposal naming convention is MIPXcY-SPZ where Y is the Process Component that contains the subproposal template and X is the MIP containing that component.

Paragraph Summary A Governance Paradigm is a complete and specific group of MIP Sets that solve an entire problem space. A problem space is defined as a list of issues that must be addressed in order for the Maker Protocol to be able to sustain itself and grow into the future Maker governance. Component Summary MIP1c1: Definitions Defines what is meant by a problem space and a Governance Paradigm. MIP1c2: The Initial Problem Space Defines an initial list of problems that will need to be solved in order for there to be a complete Governance Paradigm. MIP1c3: Changing the Governance Paradigm Defines MIPs and MIP Sets as the method used to amend or replace the Governance Paradigm. MIP1c4: Changing the Problem Space A process component that provides a method and a template for adjusting the problem space. Motivation The goal of having a defined governance paradigm is to give the community a complete overview of what specific MIPs are used to address specific problems. By having a Governance Paradigm in place, the community can reform and upgrade specific parts of the governance process while complexity and dependency issues are kept in check. At the same time, it also makes it more clear how the community can completely replace and overhaul the governance process, and create something new, while guaranteeing that all the problems that were solved by the old process are also fully solved by the new process. It is important at all times to have the best possible estimate of what the long-term problem space list will look like. The current list defined within this MIP represents the problems that the Maker Foundation currently believes need to be addressed in order to enable MakerDAO to become self-sustainable. The expectation is that this list will be changed over time as practical experience of the community is gained. After the ratification of this MIP, the Maker community can use the subproposal process to change the list at any time. Therefore, the problem space list is not permanent. The problem space list serves as a best estimate for the problems the Maker community must solve for over the course of the next few years and is expected to change as more information become available. Specification / Proposal Details MIP1c1: Definitions Problem Space A problem space is the representation of a particular problem or field of problems that must be addressed in order for the Maker Protocol to be able to sustain itself. Examples of problem spaces would be the process of onboarding new collateral types or the Maker governance decision process. Both of these complex problems require their own guidelines and produce their own set of learning experiences. Note that Problem Spaces do not define any persons or groups working in them, they are theoretical and largely static entities. Problem Spaces exist even if no one is working in that space. The Governance Paradigm Problem Space A complete list of known major issues, challenges, and opportunities that the Maker Community believes Maker Governance must be able to skillfully address and manage in order to continue to function and grow. The Governance Paradigm A complete set of processes, implemented through MIPs, that allows Maker Governance to address all of the items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. MIP Sets A MIP Set is a group of several MIPs that are interdependent, in which without the entire set of MIPs existing, one or more MIPs in the Set becomes inconsistent, invalid or nonsensical. The intention is for MIP sets to together describe a single complex behaviour in such a way that allows each individual MIP to be written following the principle of Specificity but work together as a cohesive modular whole. MIP1c2: The Initial Problem Space Problem Space List The current Governance Paradigm Problem Space is defined as follows and is organized in loose order of priority from a risk and complexity perspective: Core Governance Framework: Key governance structures laying the backbone of long-term governance, such as processes detailing how to organize executive votes and other critical processes. This is an important aspect of long-run governance and we need to put a formal structure in place in order to provide a path for all future problems to be addressed efficiently. Collateral Onboarding : A standardized process for adding collateral types to the Maker Protocol as well as a defined process for continuous management. Adding collateral to the Protocol is important for the diversification of the collateral portfolio, which is fundamental to the stability of Dai. Since Collateral onboarding is a core component of the Protocol, the Maker community requires a structured process for it to go smoothly and efficiently. Decentralized Oracle Freeze Module: Enable MKR holders to easily freeze the oracles in case of an oracle attack. Appeals Process: Enable MKR holders who abuse the Decentralized Oracle Freeze Module or other MKR-deposit based systems to be punished, as well as to appeal that punishment to MKR governance. An appeals process is important for both decentralized security modules and voter incentivization. Dai Stabilization Cycle: Manages Dai stability and other weekly adjustments. The stabilization cycle is necessary for the long-term formalization of the already existing process in order to improve transparency and accessibility. Vote Delegation: Enable vote delegation and manage the surrounding social processes. Vote delegation is crucial for long-run governance as it empowers all MKR holders to have a say by pooling their MKR to vote. Overall, vote delegation helps promote voting outcomes that more accurately represent the broader community's public discussion. Synthetic Assets: Onboard new synthetic assets and manage them on an ongoing basis. The onboarding of assets is a core component of the Protocol, thus the Maker community will require a structured process for it to go smoothly. Adding new synthetic asset types to the Maker also makes crypto assets more available to people across the globe. Oracles: As more collateral assets get onboarded to the Maker Protocol there needs to be a focus on how to scale oracles while maintaining their security. Formalizing the oracle requirements and structuring a formal process for onboarding and offboarding them is crucial to that. Emergency Oracles: Ensure emergency shutdown and oracle freeze will happen on time. Emergency oracles are crucial for keeping prices stable during the event of an emergency shutdown of the Maker Protocol. Creating a formal process for emergency oracles also ultimately helps protect both Dai and Vault owners. Dai Stability Adjustment Module: Automate Dai stability management. In the long-run, Maker governance cannot maintain the current manual process of running executive votes to constantly compute stability management, especially as more assets get onboarded to the Protocol. The DS Adjustment module will enable the continuation of stability management without the need to run executive votes. Website and Social Media: Operate makerdao.com and all official social media accounts. Communications and marketing are crucial for the brand of Maker and it is important that MKR holders have a say on how the DAO is publicly represented. The social accounts for Maker are currently maintained and run by the Maker Foundation. As we move closer towards the dissolution of the Foundation, these accounts and communication channels will need to be managed by the community and will require a formalized process in order to do so. Guardian Entities and Reserves: Source and manage a diversified reserve infrastructure. Having off-chain reserves improves the resilience of Dai during market crashes, and Guardians and reserves should decrease the risk of MKR dilution. Vote Incentives: Incentivize voting turnout and create a value-driven delegate ecosystem. Enabling incentive structures that increase voter engagement is beneficial to the broader Maker system because the bigger and more engaged the MKR voter base is, the less likely a governance attack can occur. Adding a formal voter incentive structure also allows the vote delegation mechanism to become self-sufficient in the long-run. Revisit Auction Design: A redesign of the auction mechanisms in the Maker Protocol. The current auctions system design was intended to be a short-term solution, so a redesign of the auctions could increase the efficiency of the system and reduce the probability of unexpected outcomes. Dai Foundation: Manage and fund the entity that controls legal and centralized assets, such as trademarks and copyrights, that are critical to MakerDAO. This is important for the safeguarding of the assets and preventing any possible misuse. It is critical that the community is able to have a formalized process for funding and interacting with the Dai Foundation. Important Note The problem spaces listed above are not final but rather estimates of the problems the Maker Foundation believes will need to be addressed over the course of the next few years on our path to self-sustainability. Overall, this is a starting point and does not represent a long term commitment. It is expected that it will change over time based on the needs and experience of the Maker community. MIP1c3: Changing the Governance Paradigm Amending the Governance Paradigm A Governance Paradigm can be amended by replacing specific MIPs, or an entire MIP Set, in the Governance Paradigm while maintaining correct interfacing with all other MIPs within the MIP set and wider Governance Paradigm. Replacing a Governance Paradigm A governance paradigm can be replaced in its entirety by replacing all MIPs in the Governance Paradigm with a complete grouping of new MIPs, contained in MIP Sets that fully address all items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space An individual MIP or MIP Set in the active Governance Paradigm cannot be replaced if the replacement doesn't properly interact with the other MIPs in the Governance Paradigm that the replaced MIP is dependent on, or that are dependent on the replaced MIP. Otherwise, the Governance Paradigm as a whole could break and MIPs could stop functioning correctly due to interdependency issues. Thus, you have to either replace an individual MIP or MIP Set in a Governance Paradigm or replace the entire Governance Paradigm with a completely new grouping of MIP Sets that fully address all items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. MIP1c4: Changing the Problem Space If Maker Governance wishes to change the Governance Paradigm and processes more drastically, they need to alter the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. In most cases, this is done by expanding the Problem Space after practical experience makes it clear there are additional problems, challenges or opportunities that Maker Governance needs a clear predetermined process to deal with. However, it could also be reducing the scope of the Problem Space, or changing the language or logical grouping of some of its aspects. MIP1c4 is a Process MIP component that allows the creation of subproposals that can add or delete items in the Governance Paradigm Problem Space. MIP1c4 subproposals have the following parameters: - Feedback Period : 3 months - Frozen Period : 1 month MIP1c4 subproposals must use the template located at MIP1c4-Subproposal-Template.md . This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.","title":"MIP 1"},{"location":"MIP1/mip1/#mip1-maker-governance-paradigms","text":"","title":"MIP1: Maker Governance Paradigms"},{"location":"MIP1/mip1/#preamble","text":"MIP#: 1 Title: Governance Paradigms Author(s): Rune Christensen (@Rune23) and Charles St.Louis (@CPSTL) Contributors: @LongForWisdom Type: Process Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2020-04-06 Date Ratified: 2020-05-2 Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"MIP1/mip1/#references","text":"MIP1c4-Subproposal-Template.md","title":"References"},{"location":"MIP1/mip1/#sentence-summary","text":"MIP1 defines and describes Governance Paradigms and problem spaces.","title":"Sentence Summary"},{"location":"MIP1/mip1/#paragraph-summary","text":"A Governance Paradigm is a complete and specific group of MIP Sets that solve an entire problem space.

Paragraph Summary This proposal defines the processes for onboarding, offboarding and managing Oracles. This encompasses a diverse array of components. Beginning with selecting Data Models for assets which are used for computing aggregated data into a canonical price. Continuing onward, processes are defined for adding and removing Feeds, agents who run Data Models and publish the resulting prices. Furthermore, it describes the governance procedures for creating new Oracles for new asset classes, whether they be collateral in the Maker Protocol or request by 3 rd parties. Governance controls access to read prices from the Oracles through a whitelist, enabling MKR token holders to earn revenue through regulating whitelist access. It is the responsibility of governance to administer a host of risk parameters including the Oracle Seucrity Module Delay, Oracle Expiration Time, and Oracle Spread to ensure the proper operation of the Oracle infrastructure. Component Summary Oracles Description The Maker Protocol utilizes the Oracles to obtain a real-time stream of the price of the collateral assets. This price is utilized to ensure positions are sufficiently capitalized and liquidate positions below the collateralization ratio. It also limits the maximum amount of Dai a user can generate against their collateral. Given the widespread effects the Oracles have on the Maker Protocol, it is imperative that the Data Models used in their implementations are refined to mitigate risk and optimize performance. These Data Models define where data is sourced from and how it is filtered into a canonical price. MIP10c1: Oracle Onboarding (OT) Defines a process for onboarding new oracles into the Maker Protocol. MIP10c2: Process for Oracle Onboarding Request A process component that defines the method and template to request a new Oracle. MIP10c3: Process to Onboard Oracle (OT) A process component that defines the method and template for the Oracle Team to onboard a new Oracle. MIP10c4: Process to Offboard Oracle A process component that defines the method and template to offboard an Oracle in the case it has become obsolete or otherwise undesireable. MIP10c5: List of Active Oracles A list component that is kept-up-to-date with the currently active Oracles and their properties. MIP10c6: Process for Data Model Update Request A process component that defines the method and template to request to update a Data Model. MIP10c7: Process to Update Oracle Data Model (OT) A process component that defines the method and template for the Oracle Team to update the Data Model of an asset pair. MIP10c8: List of Oracle Data Models A list component that is kept up-to-date with the ratified Oracle Data Models. Whitelist Description The ability to read data from the Oracles is regulated by a whitelist. This enables awareness of who is using the Oracle, and how, which helps mitigate fallout from migrations. Additionally it empowers governance to monetize the Oracle infrastructure as a service, the proceeds of which are funneled to MKR holders to help offset the cost of maintaining the Oracle infrastructure. MIP10c9: Process to Whitelist Oracle Access A process component that defines the method and template to whitelist access for a specific Oracle. MIP10c10: Process to Remove Oracle Access A process component that defines the method and template to remove whitelist access for a specific Oracle. MIP10c11: List of Oracle Whitelists A list component that is kept up-to-date with the whitelist for each Oracle. MIP10c12: Process to Update Oracle Access Fee A process component that defines the method and template to update the Oracle Access Fee. Feeds: Description Feeds are bots run by individuals and organizations that submit data to the Oracles. There are two types of Feeds; Dark Feeds run by anonymous individuals, and Light Feeds run by public organizations. This hybrid model preserves the hardness properties of Dark Feeds but benefits from the reputation of Light Feeds who are stakeholders in the ecosystem and are effectively staking their reputation. Feeds are paid a monthly Feed Stipend for the service they provide that is determined by governance. MIP10c13: Process to Appoint Dark Feed A process component that defines the method and template to appoint a Dark Feed. MIP10c14: Process to Appoint Light Feed A process component that defines the method and template to appoint a Light Feed. MIP10c15: Process to Appoint Feed (OT) A process component that defines the method and template for the Oracle Team to appoint a Feed. MIP10c16: Process to Remove Feed A process component that defines the method and template to remove a Feed. MIP10c17: List of Feeds A list component that is kept up-to-date with the current Feeds. MIP10c18: Process to Update Feed Stipend A process component that defines the method and template to update the Feed Stipend. Oracle Parameters: Description The Oracle system has several parameters that determine how frequently the Oracles are updated. Updating more frequently leads to a more sensitive Oracle, at the expense of higher costs. The Oracle Security Module (OSM) is the watchdog between the Oracle and the Maker Protocol. It delays prices by a delay interval before the price is utilizied by the Maker Protocol. This delay protects the Maker Protocol from Oracle attacks by enabling Governance to take emergency action during the delay period. MIP10c19: Process to Update Oracle Expiration Time A process component that defines the method and template to update the Oracle Expiration Time. MIP10c20: Process to Update Oracle Spread A process component that defines the method and template to update the Oracle Spread. MIP10c21: Process to Update Oracle Security Module Delay A process component that defines the method and template to update the Oracle Security Module Delay. Motivation In the Maker Protocol, every collateral type has a corresponding Oracle that publishes a reference price that the protocol utilizes. Therefore, the Oracle requirements must be laid out in detail for the collateral onboarding process. Governance may also choose to create Oracles for non-collateral assets for use by 3 rd parties. Specification / Proposal Details MIP10c1: Oracle Onboarding (OT) The Oracle Onboarding process is as follows: - Feedback Period: 0 days - Frozen Period: 0 days An Oracle Team publishes the MIP10c3-Subproposal-Template to the Oracle section of the Maker Forum for community review as well as submitting a PR to the MIPs Github repo. Feedback is incorporated into the MIP10c3-Subproposal-Template with changes logged in the changelog section. Changes are reflected both in the Forum thread as well as in the Github PR. The Oracle Team submits a Polling Vote to the Governance Portal. If the Oracle is being onboarded as part of the collateral onboarding process, this proposal may be bundled up with other deliverables necessary for collateral onboarding. If the Polling Vote passes, the Oracle Team will alert the Feeds to update their Oracle clients. If the Polling Vote fails the Oracle Team may make changes to the MIP10c3-Subproposal-Template and resubmit a new Polling Vote. If the Oracle Team does not, and no other Oracle Team decides to take up this responsibility, the process ends here. Oracle Team Notifies the Feeds to update their Oracle clients Alert sent out on the official Feeds Keybase channels Timeline: 1 week to deploy and 1 week to confirm stability Feeds who do not deploy within the given timeline are given a warning. Given enough warnings, governance may opt to remove the Feed through MIP10c15. If on-chain changes are necessary, the actions are bundled up in the subsequent Executive Vote. The Oracle Team(s) update MIP10c5: List of Active Oracles to append the new Oracle and submit a PR to the MIPS Github repo. The Oracle Team(s) update MIP10c8: List of Oracle Data Models to append the new Data Model and submit a PR to the MIPS Github repo. The Oracle Team(s) update MIP10c11: List of Oracle Whitelists to append all whitelist entries and submit a PR to the MIPS Github repo. MIP10c2: Process for Oracle Onboarding Request Used by the community to signal demand for onboarding new Oracles for non-collateral assets.

An Oracle Team may opt to skip this step and submit MIP10c3 A community member or other 3 rd party publishes the MIP10c2-Subproposal-Template.md in the Oracle section of the Maker Forum. Typically this will be a 3 rd party with a desire to consume the requested Oracle's data. At this point the proposal is in limbo until an Oracle Team commits to doing the work required to submit MIP10c3-Subproposal-Template and continue the Oracle Onboarding process. MIP10c3: Process to Onboard Oracle (OT) Used by the Oracle Team(s) to onboard new Oracles for collateral assets or assets requested by 3 rd parties. MIP10c3 subproposals have the following parameters: - Feedback Period: 0 days - Frozen period: 0 days MIP10c3 subproposals must use the template located at MIP10c3-Subproposal-Template.md . The Oracle Team verifies for each customer whitelisted contract: contract is verified on etherscan contract uses Oracle data in a permissioned manner so as to prohibit on-chain parasitic behavior by 3 rd parties. If Oracle data is saved to storage, it is stored in a private variable accessible exclusively by the protocol. The Oracle Team finds and selects data sources Exchange options Pair options The Oracle Team selects an appropriate Data Model (a model detailing how the data is processed to get the desired output) based on the specific asset type and what data is available. The Oracle Team completes the following technical deliverables: Update price querying tool(s) to pull from the selected data sources and implement the Data Model for that specific asset Update the Oracle client(s) to integrate the latest version of the price querying tool(s) and incorporate technical changes to publish the data. Update Relayers with contract address(es) The Oracle Team deploys and configures new instances of previously audited smart contracts for the asset type. This includes two smart contracts: Medianizer Oracle Security Module (OSM) - only required for collateral assets The Oracle Team publishes the MIP10c3-Subproposal-Template to the Oracle section of the Maker Forum for community review as well as submitting a PR to the MIPs Github repo.

After a period for the community to review and give feedback on the proposal, an Oracle Team may choose to commit to the work required to continue the Oracle Offboarding process. The Oracle Team submits a Polling Vote to the Governance Portal. If the Polling Vote passes, the Oracle Team gives 30 day notice to any customers whitelisted on the Oracle that the Oracle is shutting down. Notice is sent to each customer via the email provided in MIP10c9. The Oracle Team completes the following technical deliverables: Update price querying tool(s) to cease collecting data for the Oracle. Update the Oracle client(s) to integrate the latest version of the price querying tool(s) and cease publishing data for the Oracle. After the 30-day period has elapsed, the Oracle Team Notifies the Feeds to update their Oracle clients Alert sent out on the official Feeds Keybase channels Timeline: 1 week to deploy Feeds who do not deploy within the given timeline are given a warning. Given enough warnings, governance may opt to remove the Feed through MIP10c16. If on-chain changes are necessary, the actions are bundled up in the subsequent Executive Vote.

Motivation Risk models are a crucial element of the Maker Protocol's maintenance and growth. The models provide a representation of how a risk team intends to evaluate an asset or other part of the risk function. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to create a defined and formalized process for Risk teams to more easily onboard their models to the Maker Protocol and ultimately help grow and maintain the Protocol. Specification / Proposal Details MIP11c1: General Risk Model Requirements Description: A general model provides a representation of how a risk team intends to evaluate an asset or another part of the risk function. This can help determine which assets should be given priority as approved assets make their way into the collateral pool. A general model acts as a natural filtration mechanism where collateral types are ranked against one another for prioritization purposes. A general model must contain a quantitative risk methodology for the evaluation of risk parameters. Optionally, it can also contain: A qualitative framework that describes the process for evaluating the fundamentals of a proposed collateral asset A scoring framework for collateral assets that enables a standardized approach for converting qualitative analysis into numerical outputs. This is achieved through a ratings-based methodology.

Additionally, it will also define priority polls and the overall collateral onboarding process requirements. Furthermore, it allows domain teams to execute on collateral onboarding via the executive vote. This is the last step that needs to be completed when you have the risk construct with risk parameters based on a risk model ratified through MIP11. Specification / Proposal Details MIP12c1: Domain Team Requirements for Onboarding Collateral Type to the Maker Protocol A Risk team (elected through MIP7) builds and approves their risk construct based on a ratified general model from MIP11 (Collateral Onboarding General Risk Model Management). A Smart Contracts team (elected through MIP7) builds and approves its collateral adapter, medianizer, oracle security module and executive vote code and the technical risk assessments of these smart contracts. An Oracles team (elected through MIP7), updates the oracle operations through MIP10 (Oracle Management) and then approves of the currently active price feeds as well as builds and approves their oracle security audit/risk assessment. (Optional) A Legal team (elected through MIP7) has created and approved the legal risk assessment of the collateral type based on the work completed by the above domain teams. MIP12c2: Proposing New Risk Parameters, Oracles, and Collateral Adapters MIP12c2 is a Process MIP component that allows the any community member to propose new risk parameters, oracles, and adaptors for a new, or existing collateral type based on the work products of domain teams using a subproposal. MIP12c2 subproposals must contain the following three deliverables in the specification section: 1. A risk construct based on an active general risk model by a ratified risk team and the results of polls that define all risk parameters for the collateral type. 2. A security audit and risk assessment of a deployed and operational collateral adapter, medianizer, oracle security module and executive vote code by a smart contracts domain team. 3. A security audit and risk assessment of the current status of the oracle price feeds for supporting the new collateral type by an oracle domain team.

Paragraph Summary This proposal details the process of how Maker Governance can bootstrap the setup and implementation of the first Governance Paradigm. More specifically, it defines two phases: 1. Phase 1: when a core governance framework is put in place and a functional collateral onboarding process is ratified. 2. Phase 2: when the Problem Space is in the process of being addressed with MIPs and MIP Sets. Lastly, the proposal states that MIP2 itself will become obsolete when the Problem Space has officially been addressed. Component Summary MIP2c1: Interim Phase 1 Defines the first interim phase, in which the feedback period and freeze period for MIPs are ignored until 3 months after a core governance framework and a functional collateral onboarding process are implemented through MIPs. MIP2c2: Interim Phase 2 Defines the second interim phase, in which the feedback period and freeze period for MIPs are reduced until the initial problem space has been addressed. MIP2c3: MIP2 Obsolescence Defines the obsolescence of this MIP once the interim phases have passed. Motivation One of the critical motivations of the MIP framework is that there are a finite number of critical issues that must be covered with appropriate governance processes for the Maker system to be safe (see MIP1 Governance Paradigms). At the same time, the goal is also to ensure that the process of implementing and altering critical governance process logic is done at a pace that gives the community enough time to scrutinize and understand specific ideas. However, these two goals contradict each other in the initial \"launch period\" where there isn't a formal governance framework in place yet. As a result, the need to \"cover all bases\" by having a robust, simple solution for governance processes in place for all critical risks takes precedent over the goal of slowing down and deeply scrutinizing all proposals. Without proactive solutions in place, the community could be forced into undesirable reactive decision making in the event a critical problem or an opportunity occurs that doesn't yet have a defined process. Reactive decision making has the potential of bad precedents that weren\u2019t fully understood at the time. As a result, the community should prioritize getting the initial processes in place that will cover all the critical risks and opportunities that are built as a formalization of existing processes or knowledge in the community and Maker Foundation. Once the initial governance paradigm is in place the community can amend or replace it as necessary to build a more permanent and robust paradigm, taking advantage of the practical knowledge gained in the interim period. Specification / Proposal Details MIP2c1: Interim Phase 1 Interim Phase 1 commences when the governance timing vote elects that the initial MIPs should proceed with the ratification vote. During Interim Phase 1, the following logic overrides that defined in MIP0: 1. The Feedback Period and Frozen Period defined in MIP0 are ignored for both MIPs and Subproposals. 2. Multiple MIPs and Subproposals and can be voted in with a single vote. - Before the vote, alternatives to the MIPs within the MIP Set can be proposed if they interface correctly with all the other MIPs within the Set. During Interim Phase 1, the following additional logic is applied to the MIPs process defined in MIP0: 1. A single vote approves or rejects all MIPs and Subproposals during phase 1. 2. If rejected, MIPs can be reintroduced to the community for another vote once the issues that resulted in its initial rejection have been addressed. Interim Phase 1 ends 3 months after there is a formal a core governance framework in place and a functional collateral onboarding process. MIP2c2: Interim Phase 2 Interim Phase 2 commences as Interim Phase 1 ends. During Interim Phase 2, the following logic overrides that defined in MIP0: 1. The Feedback Period and Frozen Period defined in MIP0 are ignored for both MIPs and Subproposals. During Interim Phase 2, the following additional logic is applied to the MIPs process defined in MIP0: The Feedback Period for the MIPs and Subproposals going through the MIPs process is 1 month unless otherwise defined to be shorter. The Frozen Period for the MIPs and Subproposals going through the MIPs process is 1 week unless otherwise defined to be shorter. If rejected, MIPs and Subproposals can be reintroduced to the community for another vote once the issues that resulted in its initial rejection have been addressed. Interim Phase 2 ends when the Problem Space has been addressed. More specifically, this is when MIP Sets have been ratified that have addressed each problem statement within the Problem Space. MIP2c3: MIP2 Obsolescence Once the Problem space has been addressed, MIP2 stops having an effect and the Feedback Period and Frozen Period defined in MIP0 take effect immediately. Furthermore, MIP2 is immediately granted the Obsolete status, meaning anything defined within MIP2 should no longer be considered to be the active standard.","title":"MIP 2"},{"location":"MIP2/mip2/#mip2-launch-period","text":"","title":"MIP2: Launch Period"},{"location":"MIP2/mip2/#preamble","text":"MIP#: 2 Title: Launch Period Author(s): Rune Christensen (@Rune23), Charles St.Louis (@CPSTL) Contributors: @LongForWisdom Type: Process Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2020-04-06 Date Ratified: 2020-05-02 Dependencies: MIP0, MIP1 Replaces: n/a","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"MIP2/mip2/#references","text":"No referenced materials.","title":"References"},{"location":"MIP2/mip2/#sentence-summary","text":"MIP2 details two interim phases during which logic defined in MIP0 is overriden.","title":"Sentence Summary"},{"location":"MIP2/mip2/#paragraph-summary","text":"This proposal details the process of how Maker Governance can bootstrap the setup and implementation of the first Governance Paradigm.

Paragraph Summary This proposal formally introduces a Governance Cycle. The Governance Cycle provides a predictable framework for Maker Governance decisions. Furthermore, it provides participants (MKR holders) with a monthly overview of the decisions that are to be made, allowing participation despite time constraints. Component Summary MIP3c1: Governance Cycle Definitions Defines key terms related to the Governance cycle. MIP3c2: Governance Cycle Breakdown Breaks the Governance Cycle down into the actions that take place each week of the monthly cycle. MIP3c3: Default Inclusion Threshold Modification Subproposals A process component that defines a method and template for the modification of the default inclusion threshold. Motivation The goal of the standardized monthly governance cycle is to provide advance notification and high predictability of governance activities in order to enable MKR holders to stay informed on relevant topics and participate in voting despite being time-constrained. The structure of the governance cycle enables active governance participants to join the discussion at the proposal submission level from the beginning of the month, while less active governance participants can simply review the end results at the end of the month and decide whether or not to vote for the final executive vote. Specification / Proposal Details MIP3c1: Governance Cycle Definitions Default Inclusion Threshold is a variable amount that can be changed by MIP3c3 subproposals. The default inclusion threshold value is automatically counted towards the no vote tally of each item in the inclusion poll. The default inclusion threshold is set at 3000 MKR but can be changed with MIP3c2 subproposals . Inclusion Poll When governance users decide what they want to bundle together into the governance poll. The inclusion poll also serves as the threshold to necessitate the attention of a governance poll. An important aspect of the inclusion poll is that it allows MKR holders to have a big impact early on in the governance cycle. Governance Poll The Governance Poll is a yes/no MKR poll that accepts or rejects the combination of all MIPs that passed the inclusion poll stage, including acceptance of any executive vote code from Technical MIP components or subproposals. Executive Vote The final vote to determine if proposals ultimately gets accepted or rejected. MIP3c2: Governance Cycle Breakdown Each monthly governance cycle begins on the first Monday of the month, with Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) submitted by community members (defined within the MIP0 Framework). These proposals will be considered for inclusion at the end of the month's Executive vote. The governance cycle ends with an Executive vote that begins on the 4 th Monday of the month. Proposals submitted must follow the guidelines defined in MIP0. Week-by-week breakdown of the Monthly Governance Cycle Time is inclusive and in based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and the Gregorian calendar Week 1, Monday - The Formal Submission (Phase 5 described in MIP0c3 ) of proposals that are to be included in the new governance cycle by the MIP Authors. This phase lasts for 3 days. - The formal submission of MIPs are done on the formal submission category on the MakerDAO forums under the Maker Improvement Proposal subcategory (as defined in Phase 5 in MIP0c3 ). Week 1, Thursday - Governance Facilitators do the Submission Review as part of the governance meeting and determine which of the proposed MIPs are in accordance with guidelines (defined in the MIP0 Framework) and should be included in the inclusion poll. Week 2, Monday - The Governance facilitators publish the set of Inclusion Polls , one per proposal. Each poll has two options: - Yes or no. - Where the no votes simply increase the barrier of the proposal to pass. - If the Yes votes for a given option in the inclusion poll are higher than the combination of No votes and the default inclusion threshold at the end of the Inclusion Poll, the proposal will be included in the Governance Poll . - The default inclusion threshold is set to 3000 MKR. - If votes: yes ( no + default inclusion threshold ) = inclusion in governance poll. Week 2, Thursday The Governance facilitators do the Inclusion Review as part of the governance meeting in which they confirm the inclusions in the Governance Poll . Week 3, Monday - The Governance Poll is submitted by the Governance Facilitators. This poll runs for 3 days. Week 3,Thursday - The Governance Facilitators do the Governance Poll Review as part of the governance meeting in which they confirm the outcome of the Governance Poll . - The Governance Facilitators must come to consensus on whether the results of the governance poll warrant moving forward to the executive vote. - This responsibility is intended to be used in the case in which the Governance Facilitators believe that moving forward to an Executive Vote would negatively affect community cohesion. - If the Governance Facilitators oppose the Governance Poll outcome, they must clearly communicate their reasons for disregarding the poll results. - In the event the Governance Faciltiators abuse this power, they should be removed using a MIP0c13 subproposal . Week 4, Monday - The Executive Vote is submitted if the Governance Facilitators confirm the 'yes' outcome of the Governance Poll . - The Executive Vote must have an expiration of 4 days, after which is has no effect. - MIPs and subproposals only move to the 'Accepted' status if the executive vote they are included in passes within the 4-day limit. If the executive vote fails to pass within the 4-day limit, the MIPs and subproposals have their status changed to 'Rejected'. Week 4, Thursday - The Governance Facilitators do the Governance Cycle Review as part of the governance meeting in which they summarize and discuss the Governance Cycle with the community. - The Governance Facilitators also discuss the upcoming governance cycle and potential submissions with the community. Governance Cycle Overview MIP Life Cycle Overview MIP3c3: Default Inclusion Threshold Modification Subproposals MIP3c2 is a Process MIP component that allows the Default Inclusion Threshold to be modified for the Inclusion poll. This is done through a subproposal. The subproposals are submitted to the governance cycle like any other proposal and if ratified, their modified default inclusion threshold takes effect from the governance cycle following the successful passing of their governance cycle\u2019s executive vote. MIP3c2 subproposals have the following parameters: - Default Feedback Period : 3 months - Frozen Period : 1 month MIP3c2 subproposals must use the template located at MIP3c2-Subproposal-Template.md .

Paragraph Summary The Amendment and Removal Process-MIP outlines the process for very small and relatively superficial changes to MIPs. This MIP Contains two Process Components, the first dealing with the Removal of ratified MIPs, and the second dealing with Amending current active MIPs. Component Summary MIP4c1: Purpose Description Suggests the purpose of the amendment and removal processes and possible reasons for using each process. MIP4c2: MIP Amendment Process A process component which defines a method and template for the amendment of an accepted MIP. MIP4c3: MIP Removal Process A process component which defines a method and template for the removal of an accepted MIP. Motivation The motivation behind this proposal is that changing small details to MIPs should not require the original MIP to become obsolete or replaced, so this Process-MIP is needed to define and outline the process behind making these changes to MIPs once they have already been ratified and implemented. Additionally, this MIP defines the process for the removal of MIPs that are have become no longer useful. Specification / Proposal Details MIP4c1: Purpose Description Amendments MIP Amendments that preserve the MIP number can be performed as long as there are no changes to the logic of the MIP or to the MIP's external output dependencies. They should only be used when minor changes are required. Validity The validity of MIP Amendments is ultimately up to the community but possible reasons for amendments could be (but are not limited to): - A formatting change - Typos - Rewording/clarification MIP Amendments are invalid if, based on the assessment of the community, the changes are so severe that they should be achieved through a MIP replacement instead. Removals MIP4 also enables the removal of MIPs that are no longer useful. If there are other MIPs that depend on a MIP that is being removed, they must also be removed in the same governance cycle, or the proposal will be invalid. MIP4c2: MIP Amendment Process MIP4c2 is a Process MIP component that allows the amendment of an Accepted MIP using a subproposal. MIP4c2 subproposals have the following parameters: - Default Feedback Period : 3 months - Frozen Period : 1 month MIP4c2 subproposals must use the template located at MIP4c2-Subproposal-Template.md .

Sentence Summary MIP5 defines emergency changes to the protocol and Governance Facilitator role and how they should be handled in practice. Paragraph Summary This proposal defines an emergency voting system. Emergency votes are executive votes that can be initiated by any community member. Component Summary MIP5c1: Governance Facilitator Emergency Votes This component addresses the emergency removal of an individual from the Governance Facilitator role. MIP5c2: An Emergency State Change This component addresses emergency state changes to the protocol and how they are to be handled by the Governance Facilitators. Motivation This standard is being proposed in order to allow the community to overcome the constraints of the governance cycle ( MIP3 ) in special situations where it is time critical to make changes or remove a part of the operating system. Specification / Proposal Details MIP5c1: Governance Facilitator Emergency Votes A governance facilitator emergency vote encodes one or more website URLs into an on-chain voting contract (spell), as well as containing logic that stops any payment stream to the existing governance facilitators. If the executive vote gets the most MKR votes and becomes the active proposal the existing Governance facilitators are then removed. The list of website URLs then corresponds to a list of one or more new Interim Governance facilitators and their governance platforms that will replace the current governance facilitators. The current governance cycle is canceled, and the new Interim Governance Facilitators initiate a new governance cycle on the following 1 st Monday of the month. MIP5c2: An Emergency State Change An emergency executive vote that contains state change logic. For example, changing the DSR or removing a collateral type. These types of votes can in some cases be used to reduce risk in the system, help stabilize the peg, or fix critical technical issues. However, they are also very dangerous and must be used carefully as they can potentially be attacks that, for example, drain all the collateral from the system. Governance Facilitators can ignore an emergency state change, or either declare support for an emergency state change by adding it as an irregularly scheduled executive vote on their governance portals, or declare it a governance attack, potentially encouraging users to trigger an emergency shutdown in response.","title":"MIP 5"},{"location":"MIP5/mip5/#mip5-emergency-voting-system","text":"","title":"MIP5: Emergency Voting System"},{"location":"MIP5/mip5/#preamble","text":"MIP#: 5 Title: Emergency Voting System Author(s): Rune Christensen (@Rune23), Charles St.Louis (@CPSTL) Contributors: @LongForWisdom Type: Process Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2020-04-06 Date Ratified: 2020-05-02 Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"MIP5/mip5/#references","text":"No referenced materials.","title":"References"},{"location":"MIP5/mip5/#sentence-summary","text":"MIP5 defines emergency changes to the protocol and Governance Facilitator role and how they should be handled in practice.","title":"Sentence Summary"},{"location":"MIP5/mip5/#paragraph-summary","text":"This proposal defines an emergency voting system.

Paragraph Summary The purpose of this proposal is to standardize the collateral onboarding form/forum template that community members and third-party projects can use to begin the process of getting their collateral onboarded to the Maker Protocol. Component Summary MIP6c1: Process Overview Provides an overview of the collateral application form submission process which includes location, involved stakeholders and the next phase. MIP6c2: Application Template Provides an collateral application form template to be used in the submission process defined in MIP6c1. MIP6c3: Application Template Amendment Process A process component that defines a method and template to amend the collateral application form template defined in MIP6c2. Motivation This proposal aims to layout one part of the generalized process for adding collateral types to the Maker Protocol. This will allow the community to get an idea of what the applying collateral is, an overview of the risks, and an understanding of the potential benefits to Maker. A consistent application form allows prospective collateral types to be compared by the community. The pitch materials allow the interested party to generate interest from the Maker community. Although this is only one component of the overall collateral onboarding process, this proposed standard would decrease confusion surrounding how to start the process of getting collateral added to the Maker Protocol and ultimately, increase the onboarding speed at which new collateral types can be onboarded. Specification / Proposal Details MIP6c1: Process Overview Collateral Onboarding Form / Form Template 1. Fill out the application/questions in as much detail as you\u2019re willing. - Once filled out, the application must be published on the official MakerDAO forum and should be posted within the `Collateral Onboarding App` subcategory within the `Maker Improvement Proposals` category. - This post should have the tag `collateral-app`. - Note that an interested party refers to anybody willing to act as a stakeholder for this onboarding process. After the submission on the forum, the community will likely have follow up questions. While not a requirement, answering questions about your project may help generate support or excitement for the proposed collateral type. Additionally, the interested party may organize an optional call to pitch their proposal as well as open up further discussion to the community. Once the application has been submitted to the forum, it is eligible for Domain Greenlight as defined in MIP8. After two weeks of discussion have passed, and Domain Greenlight (MIP8) has been completed, the application is eligible to move to the Community Greenlight poll defined in MIP9. Overall Process Overview Diagram MIP6c2: Application Template MIP6c2 defines a template for collateral applications as described in MIP6c1.

Paragraph Summary The Domain Teams Onboarding Offboarding proposal provides a predictable framework for both onboarding and offboarding domain teams required for the collateral onboarding process. Component Summary MIP7c1: Domain Team Descriptions Describes the various domain teams and their responsibilities as they relate to the collateral onboarding process. MIP7c2: The Current Domain Roles List A list component that is kept up-to-date with the currently ratified domain teams. MIP7c3: Domain Team onboarding A process component that defines a method and a template that allows the onboarding of domain teams. MIP7c4: Domain Team offboarding A process component that defines a method and a template that allows the offboarding of domain teams. Motivation The Maker Protocol requires a decentralized workforce in order to onboard new collateral assets. This MIP describes Domain Teams that are needed in the collateral onboarding process and highlights their special authority in the governance system to oversee critical processes and mitigate risk. Specification / Proposal Details MIP7c1: Domain Team Descriptions Oracle Teams are responsible for designing oracle feed mechanisms for new collateral types, compelling the oracles to upgrade their nodes with new price feeds for new collateral types via MIP10, and creating the oracle work product for collateral onboarding. Smart Contracts Teams are responsible for developing and deploying the collateral adapter for new collateral onboarding, and creating the technical work product for collateral onboarding proposals. Risk Teams are responsible for creating the risk construct for a collateral onboarding proposal. As a part of the collateral on-boarding process, they also need to get a general model ratified on which they can base their risk construct. Legal Teams are in some cases necessary for collateral onboarding, when dealing with assets that have legal claims attached to them. They create the legal work product for collateral onboarding. MIP7c2: The Current Domain Roles List This list can be amended through the onboarding (MIP7c3) and offboarding components (MIP7c4) of MIP7. Entries into this list should follow the following template: Team Name: The name of the onboarded domain team. - Sub-proposal Number (MIP7c3-SP): # - Domain: The domain in which the team operates. - Date Added: (yyyy-mm-dd) Active Domain Teams List 1. Oracle Domain Teams: - Team Name: Green Team - Sub-proposal Number (MIP7c3-SP): n/a (Oracle Team was ratified prior to the MIPs process. Reference: Mandate: Oracle Teams ) - Domain: Oracle - Date Added: 2019-10-7 Poll: Ratify the Interim Oracle Team Mandate 2. Smart Contracts Domain Teams: Team Name: Blue Team Sub-proposal Number (MIP7c3-SP): 1 Domain: Smart Contracts Date Added: 2020-05-02 Ratification Vote 3. Risk Domain Teams: 4. Legal Domain Teams: MIP7c3: Domain Team Onboarding MIP7c3 is a Process MIP component that allows the onboarding of a domain team using a subproposal. If onboarded through a MIP7c3 subproposal, the domain team is added to the The Current Domain Team Roles list defined in MIP7c2 by a MIP Editor. MIP7c3 subproposals have the following parameters: - Feedback Period : 3 months - Frozen Period : 1 month MIP7c3 subproposals must use the template located at MIP7c3-Subproposal-Template.md .

MIP7c4: Domain Team offboarding MIP7c4 is a Process MIP component that allows the removal of a domain team using a subproposal. If offboarded through a MIP7c4 subproposal the domain team is removed from the Current Domain Team Roles list defined in MIP7c2 by a MIP Editor. MIP7c4 subproposals have the following parameters: - Feedback Period : 0 days - Frozen Period : 0 days MIP7c4 subproposals must use the template located at MIP7c4-Subproposal-Template.md .

Sentence Summary MIP8 defines the process by which domain teams signal that a potential collateral type is worth the time spent investigating its inclusion in the Maker Protocol. Paragraph Summary This proposal aims to define the process where at least one domain team from each domain (Risk, Smart Contracts, Oracles, Legal, etc) \"Greenlights\" the collateral type (based on research) in order for the collateral onboarding process to proceed. Component Summary MIP8c1: Domain Greenlight Requirements Defines the responsibilities of the domain teams in the domain greenlight process. MIP8c2: Domain Greenlight Process Defines the domain greenlight process and its interaction with the collateral onboarding process. MIP8c3: Domain Greenlight Outcomes Defines the possible outcomes from the domain greenlight process. Motivation The goal of this proposal is to inform the community about the pre-evaluation stage with the aim of identifying any show-stopping problems before time is spent on a full evaluation of the collateral type. Specification / Proposal Details In this stage, the domain teams will signal that they believe the collateral type is worth the time to perform a full evaluation in their respective domain. Note that this stage may happen in parallel to the MIP6 process, but communication from the Domain teams should always come within two weeks of the end of the allotted review time for MIP6's collateral onboarding form/forum publication. MIP8c1: Domain Greenlight Requirements If unresolvable issues arise with a specific domain, that domain team is responsible for communicating that they have rejected the collateral type to both the interested party and the community via the Maker forums. The domain team will provide a reason for rejection as part of this communication. If resolvable issues arise with a specific domain, that domain team is responsible for communicating that the collateral is deferred to both the interested party, and to the community via the Maker forums. This communication will include an explanation for the change in status and the criteria that should be met before they resume work. If there are no issues that warrant stopping this process, then each domain team is responsible for communicating that they are happy to proceed to a full evaluation. This is done by a member of each type of domain team making a forum reply to the MIP6 collateral application forum post saying they have done a MIP8 review and found no issues. MIP8c2: Domain Greenlight Process In case new information becomes available that changes the assessment of a domain team, they can revoke their greenlight by posting that they are revoking it in the same forum post. If domain greenlight fails from one or multiple domain teams, it does not prevent the asset from being considered for collateral onboarding. It only prevents it from being onboarded if there is not an alternative team in that domain willing to greenlight it. Overall Process Overview Diagram MIP8c3: Domain Greenlight Outcomes Regardless of whether any issues are raised, the process continues with MIP9 (Community Greenlight). If deferred , a resumption criterion is defined and communicated clearly. Until all deferred criteria are met, the deferring domain team will not work on the collateral.

Sentence Summary MIP9 defines the process by which MKR Token Holders can signal their judgment on the value of a potential collateral type before domain teams spend time thoroughly investigating its inclusion into the Maker Protocol. Paragraph Summary This proposal aims to standardize the process for allowing MKR Token Holders to inform the Domain Teams of their preferences for collateral types that have been proposed through MIP6. The preferences of the MKR Token holders are expressed in the form of an on-chain governance poll. The governance poll (Greenlight poll) runs at the end of the governance cycle and will run for a period of two weeks. Component Summary MIP9c1: The Community Greenlight Requirements and Process Defines the process, requirements and possible outcomes from Community Greenlight process and the Governance Facilitators responsibilities in its operation. MIP9c2: Governance Poll Template Defines a governance poll template to be used in the on-chain Community Greenlight poll. Motivation While domain teams are free to choose their own workload, an on-chain governance poll provides the Domain Teams key insights into the community's sentiment for each collateral type that has been proposed. In addition to this, it is important to gather the opinion of MKR Token Holders towards the proposed collateral asset before the full domain work takes place. This helps prevent work from being wasted on undesirable collateral types. Specification / Proposal Details In this stage, the Governance Facilitator (GF) will create an on-chain governance poll in the template format defined in MIP9c2 and the community will vote with their preferences. MIP9c1: The Community Greenlight Requirements and Process The process begins when an interested party (collateral type proposer) informs the Governance Facilitator(s) that the collateral application process has reached the Community Greenlight phase. The collateral form (MIP6) has been submitted to the forum and/or has received Domain Greenlight approval (MIP8) from each of the domain teams (smart contracts, risk and oracles). From then on, the Governance Facilitator(s) are responsible for creating a Community Greenlight Poll for the collateral type in question. Note that an individual approval poll is created for each collateral asset. This poll will use the format defined in MIP9c2 (Governance Poll Template), using ETH as an example collateral type. The greenlight polls happen at a fixed time each governance cycle, from the 4 th Monday of the month to the 4 th Friday of the month. The Governance Facilitator(s) are responsible for maintaining a list of collaterals based on the outcome of the individual Community Greenlight Polls. This list should include collateral types that have both passed and failed to pass their Community Greenlight Polls. The collateral assets in the polls will be listed and ranked based on their score. As noted above (3), the list includes the collateral types that have both passed and failed to pass in the Community Greenlight Polls. It's important to include assets that have failed (negative score) to still be considered based on the domain teams judgment call, because you could have situations where competitors are trying to use MKR to suppress each other's assets in order to get a competitive edge and thus, unfairly put them at a disadvantage by denying them funding from Maker. Any collateral asset that has passed MIP8, and not had any of its MIP8 greenlight approvals revoked again, including assets that have already had a greenlight poll before, will be included in the MIP9 community greenlight polls, except when for technical reasons there is not enough capacity to hold all the votes, in which case the governance facilitator decides the most important assets to include, prioritizing those that haven't had a vote before. Important Note: MIP9 may happen in parallel with MIP8 (Domain Greenlight). Key Outcomes from the Governance Poll Once the Community Greenlight Poll is complete. The Domain teams proceed to perform their respective work defined in their mandates. Example: The Smart contracts team will build the collateral adaptor and the risk team will build their risk construct for the specified collateral type. If the Community Greenlight Poll passes and Domain Greenlight (MIP8) fails in one or more domains, the community must find a substitute for the rejecting domain teams before this process can proceed. If the Community Greenlight Poll fails the Domain teams are free to work on the collateral if they hold confidence that governance will approve it in the future.

Conception: The lifecycle of a MIP begins when the MIP proposal is posted on the Maker forum. However, in order for a MIP to move to the next stage, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria (1) described below: Submitted to the MIPs Discourse Forum. Submitted to the MIPs Github repository (with a Pull Request created by the MIP Author or MIP Editor). The format must follow the appropriate MIP Template for its type. MIPs must be original or replacement versions of older MIPs (No repeats allowed). 2. Approved by MIP Editor(s): This phase of a MIP\u2019s life cycle is when the MIP Editor(s) confirms that the proposed MIP follows the correct structure and editorial criteria defined in the MIP template. If the criteria is not met, the MIP Editor(s) will provide an explanation to the MIP Author as to why and allow them to make the appropriate changes before reconsideration. If the criteria have been met, the MIP Editor(s) performs the following actions: The MIP is approved by a MIP Editor(s) and is assigned a formal MIP number. The PR is merged in by a MIP Editor(s). 3. Request for Comments (RFC): This phase is when a MIP goes through a formal review period, including feedback from the community, further drafting and additions. The timeline for the RFC phase is defined by its Feedback Period and Frozen Period. In order to move to the next phase, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria listed below: MIP Author finalizes changes of the MIP, based on community feedback. MIPs have a Feedback Period of 3 months. The RFC phase lasts at least 3 months before the MIP can move to the next phase. MIPs have a Frozen Period of 1 month. MIPs must not have had any changes for the last 1 month before they move to the next phase. 4. Fulfilled Feedback Period Requirements: This status is given once the MIP has fulfilled the defined Feedback Period and Frozen Period. After the MIP has waited out its Feedback Period and Frozen Period, it\u2019s ready for Formal Submission. Note that the Feedback Period and Frozen Period can overlap. 5. Formal Submission (FS) - This phase is when MIP Authors submit their complete MIP(s) to the Governance cycle by posting it to the formal submission forum category within the formal submission window of a governance cycle. - A MIP can be re-submitted to the formal submission process a maximum of 2 additional times (3 total), without having to go through phase 1- 4 again, if it failed to pass due to legitimate external reasons (e.g. got bundled in a governance poll or executive vote with a controversial proposal - subject to the governance facilitators judgement). 6. Approved by the Governance Facilitator(s) : This phase is when the MIP must be formally approved by the Governance Facilitators. Once approved by the Governance Facilitator, the MIP will be included in the inclusion poll of the Governance cycle. If the MIP is not approved by the Governance Facilitator, it may be reconsidered at a later date to enter the Governance cycle. 7. Governance Cycle : This phase is when MKR holders vote on whether to include the MIP in the governance poll, ultimately determining whether or not the MIP can formally enter the governance cycle. - Once approved for the governance poll, MKR holders determine whether to accept or reject the package of proposals in the governance poll and finally to ratify the result in the executive vote. 8. Executive Vote: This phase is when the MIP becomes officially ratified or not. Determined by MKR holders, the executive vote ultimately accepts or rejects the MIP. 9. Accepted/Rejected: The Executive vote results in either acceptance or rejection of the MIP. If passed, the MIP is officially accepted and is given the accepted status. If the executive vote fails to pass before expiring, the MIP is rejected. As described in phase 5, a rejected MIP, can be resubmitted, and in some cases (if it was rejected for provable extraneous explanation) may be allowed to enter the next Governance cycle immediately. Other MIP Statuses: Withdrawn : when a MIP Author withdraws their MIP proposal, such as when: A MIP may be withdrawn at any point before it enters the Governance cycle. Note that a withdrawn proposal can be taken over from the original Author with a simple transition facilitated by a MIP Editor(s) and the respective parties. If the original MIP Author ceases to be available, the MIP Editor(s) may proceed with the transfer of Authors. Deferred : when a proposal has been deemed as not ready or not a priority but can be re-proposed at a later date. Request for Comments (RFC) - Forum poll/signal request rejects a MIP Proposal. Obsolete : when a proposal is no longer used or is out of date, such as: A MIP is replaced with a new proposal. A MIP has been deferred for over 6 months. A MIP Author has abandoned the proposal and no person has communicated willingness to take over MIP Author responsibility. A MIP has been replaced by a newer, more updated MIP Proposal. A MIP no longer makes sense to keep in consideration. MIP Status Change Process: A status change for a MIP is requested by the MIP Author and will be reviewed by the MIP Editor(s) to see if it meets the status criteria of the requested status change. If it does, the Editor(s) will change the status of the MIP and the Author may proceed with the next stage of the process. If it does not, the MIP Editor(s) will revert with highlighted issues, and the Author must fix the highlighted issues before requesting another status change.","title":"Lifecycle"},{"location":"process/lifecycle/#the-lifecycle-of-mips","text":"","title":"The Lifecycle of MIPs"},{"location":"process/lifecycle/#mip-statuses","text":"1. Conception: The lifecycle of a MIP begins when the MIP proposal is posted on the Maker forum. However, in order for a MIP to move to the next stage, it needs to satisfy the transition criteria (1) described below: Submitted to the MIPs Discourse Forum. Submitted to the MIPs Github repository (with a Pull Request created by the MIP Author or MIP Editor). The format must follow the appropriate MIP Template for its type. MIPs must be original or replacement versions of older MIPs (No repeats allowed). 2. Approved by MIP Editor(s): This phase of a MIP\u2019s life cycle is when the MIP Editor(s) confirms that the proposed MIP follows the correct structure and editorial criteria defined in the MIP template.
