# Submitting MIPs and Sub-proposals

This page provides all the information you need to understand what kinds of sub-proposals you can submit based on the [currently active MIP set](../accepted).

It also provides the different templates you'll require, not just for each different kind of sub-proposal, but for submitting entirely new General and Technical MIPs.

Note that MIPs 2, 5, 8 and 9 have no process components, hence no subproposals can be generated with them and so they do not appear in the sidebar.
