# Collateral Onboarding

Collateral onboarding applications operate like any other [sub-proposal](../submit) within the MIP governance framework, though we expect that they will be the most regular kind of application. Moreover, these sub-proposals are a critical part of the long-term sustainability and stability of MakerDAO itself, and so they deserve their own dedicated section.

**This section has two clear aims:**

1. Make clear and easy the process anyone must follow to submit an application to include a new kind of collateral in the Maker protocol.
2. Track current applications and their states so that the community can keep a close eye on the risks we are agreeing to take on.

The process for collateral onboarding is defined in [MIP6](../accepted/mip6), which was itself developed from a [community-created collateral onboarding document](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/collateral-onboarding-process-v1/1412). The goal of this MIP is to provide an end-to-end framework for scalable collateral onboarding that interoperates with the Governance Cycle and the existing Domain Teams.
