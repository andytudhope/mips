# Governing Better Money

We are committed to decentralization. This site is one more step along the steady path which began with the first MKR vote on our [Core Foundation Principles](https://blog.makerdao.com/foundation-proposal-v2/), gathered momentum with the [transfer of MKR token control from the Foundation to the governance community](https://blog.makerdao.com/the-transfer-of-mkr-token-control-to-governance-the-final-step/) and continues now with Maker Improvement Proposals. 

The purpose of this site is to provide the MakerDAO governance community with the tools and information required to manage and improve the DAI stablecoin system effectively. 

You can monitor updates to the protocol on this site, or dive in and join the daily debates on our forum:
